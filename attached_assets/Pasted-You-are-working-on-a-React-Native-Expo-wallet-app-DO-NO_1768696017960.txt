You are working on a React Native Expo wallet app. DO NOT refactor unrelated code. DO NOT change swap execution logic, quote logic, or server APIs. Only fix UI logic and labels related to Speed Mode and Max Priority Fee Cap, and hide the “Cordon Success Fee” UI section entirely.

GOALS
1) Fix contradiction: when Speed Mode (Standard/Fast/Turbo) is selected, it must set the Max Priority Fee Cap to the matching value automatically.
2) Advanced chips (0.001/0.005/0.01/0.02) should still work as manual overrides, BUT once a user manually selects a chip, Speed Mode should visually switch to a new state called “Custom” (or deselect Standard/Fast/Turbo).
3) Hide/remove the “Cordon Success Fee” row from Swap UI (do NOT remove backend fee logic if any exists; only remove UI so it’s not shown).
4) Ensure labels are accurate: Turbo is not a fee itself, it’s a preset that sets a higher priority fee cap.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Find the Swap screen UI (client/screens/SwapScreen.tsx).
- Identify current state for speed mode (e.g. "standard" | "fast" | "turbo") and current priority fee cap (e.g. maxPriorityFeeSol or similar).
- There is currently a mismatch where Turbo shows 0.005 SOL but cap can remain 0.001 SOL. Fix this with deterministic mapping.
- Create constants:
  SPEED_PRESETS = {
    standard: 0.0008,
    fast: 0.002,
    turbo: 0.005,
  }
  PRIORITY_CAP_CHOICES = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02]
- On selecting a Speed Mode button:
  - setSpeedMode(mode)
  - setMaxPriorityFeeCapSol(SPEED_PRESETS[mode])
  - setPriorityFeeIsCustom(false)
- On selecting a cap chip:
  - setMaxPriorityFeeCapSol(value)
  - setPriorityFeeIsCustom(true)
  - setSpeedMode("custom") OR clear selection UI for standard/fast/turbo and show “Custom” label.
- UI behavior:
  - Display "Cap: X SOL" where X equals maxPriorityFeeCapSol
  - Speed buttons show their preset amounts, but the selected button must always match the cap unless custom is active.
  - If custom is active, highlight none (or highlight "Custom") and keep cap chips functional.

HIDE SUCCESS FEE UI
- In SwapScreen.tsx find the section that renders:
  “Cordon Success Fee … charged only if swap confirms …”
  and the toggle.
- Remove that entire block from rendering (or wrap in `false && (...)`).
- Do NOT remove any fee calculations or swap params elsewhere.

TESTS / CHECKS
- Select Turbo => cap immediately becomes 0.005 SOL and chip state updates accordingly.
- Select Standard => cap becomes 0.0008 SOL (note: if 0.0008 isn’t in chip list, cap should still show 0.0008, and no chip should be highlighted unless you add a chip for 0.0008; that’s okay).
- Select a cap chip (0.001 etc) => speed selection becomes Custom and no preset is shown as selected.
- Ensure no other swap behavior changes.

After changes, provide:
- The exact lines changed in SwapScreen.tsx
- A short explanation of state transitions (preset -> custom).
