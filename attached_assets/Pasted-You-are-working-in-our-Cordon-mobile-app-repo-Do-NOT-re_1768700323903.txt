You are working in our Cordon mobile app repo. Do NOT refactor unrelated code. Make minimal, safe changes only. Goal: fix wallet add/import UX + PIN flow + active wallet refresh + freeze issue. Keep existing working features.

PROBLEMS TO FIX:
A) After creating/importing a 2nd wallet, app still navigates to Set PIN even though PIN is already set. It shows “PIN Already Set… Redirecting” popup. This is wrong: PIN is device-level; if already set, skip SetPin screen entirely.
B) WalletSwitcherSheet “+ Add Wallet” is confusing: it only leads to Create Wallet. We want “Add Wallet” to offer BOTH Create and Import, matching our dark theme. Import should not be hidden only behind Manage.
C) After closing the add-wallet popup/menu, sometimes the app freezes (can’t tap anything). Likely a modal/backdrop overlay not being dismissed properly.
D) After import/create wallet, active wallet should become the newly added wallet immediately AND portfolio/assets should refresh for the new wallet address. Currently it still shows assets/custom tokens from old wallet (e.g., FREE appears, SOL/ROACHY missing), meaning active wallet and portfolio hooks/cache are stale.

FILES:
- Wallet switcher bottom sheet: client/components/WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx
- Wallet store/context: client/lib/wallet-context.tsx
- Portfolio hooks:
  - client/hooks/usePortfolio.ts
  - client/hooks/useSolanaPortfolio.ts
  - client/hooks/useAllChainsPortfolio.ts
- Portfolio cache layer: client/lib/portfolio-cache.ts
- PIN flow screens/services (search these):
  - client/screens/SetPin*.tsx or similar
  - client/lib/pin*.ts or similar
  - any navigation that routes to SetPin after wallet create/import

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (MINIMAL CHANGES):
1) FIX “ADD WALLET” UX (WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx)
   - When user taps “+ Add Wallet”, open a small themed action sheet / modal (same dark theme) with 2 options:
     - “Create New Wallet”
     - “Import Wallet”
   - Each option should navigate to the existing Create Wallet screen or Import Wallet screen.
   - Ensure closing/dismissing the action sheet NEVER freezes touches:
     - The modal/backdrop must unmount on close.
     - Backdrop should not keep pointerEvents after close.
     - Make sure state is set to false on dismiss.
   - Use existing components/utilities if present (existing BottomSheet/Modal component). If none exists, implement a very small React Native Modal with:
     - transparent backdrop
     - centered card
     - two buttons styled like our UI
     - tapping backdrop closes it

2) FIX PIN FLOW (SKIP SetPin if already set)
   - Find where we route to SetPin after wallet create/import.
   - Before navigating, check if a PIN already exists in secure storage (whatever our current mechanism is).
   - If PIN exists:
     - DO NOT navigate to SetPin.
     - Just continue the create/import flow and navigate to Home.
   - If PIN does NOT exist:
     - Navigate to SetPin normally.
   - Also make SetPin screen safe:
     - On mount, if pinAlreadyExists, immediately navigate back/home without showing a blocking modal that might cause overlay freeze.

3) AFTER CREATE/IMPORT: AUTO-SET ACTIVE WALLET + NAVIGATE HOME
   - When create wallet succeeds OR import wallet succeeds:
     - call setActiveWallet(newWalletId) (or setActiveWalletByAddress) in wallet-context
     - ensure wallet dropdown/header shows the new wallet instantly
     - navigate/reset to the main Home screen (Main tab) so user lands in the new wallet view
   - This should happen regardless of Multi-chain or Solana-only wallet types.

4) PORTFOLIO/ASSETS MUST REFRESH FOR ACTIVE WALLET
   - Ensure portfolio hooks depend on active wallet address (and chain IDs) correctly.
     - If using React Query/SWR-like keys, include walletAddress in the key.
     - If using useEffect, include activeWallet.address in dependency array.
   - Fix portfolio-cache.ts so cache keys include wallet address + chain (avoid showing old wallet balances).
   - On setActiveWallet, invalidate/clear portfolio cache for the new address or trigger refetch.
   - Ensure custom tokens don’t appear as “owned” unless the current wallet actually has balance. If we always list custom tokens, they should still show 0 balance but MUST NOT replace/override the wallet address used for fetching.

5) QUICK SAFETY CHECKS
   - Do not break existing swaps/transactions.
   - Add simple console logs behind a dev flag if needed:
     - when active wallet changes
     - when portfolio fetch runs (print wallet address)
   - After changes, verify:
     - Tap “+ Add Wallet” => see Create/Import options styled correctly
     - Closing the menu does not freeze UI
     - Create wallet => no SetPin if PIN already set; directly goes Home; new wallet is active
     - Import wallet => same behavior
     - Portfolio shows SOL/ROACHY for the newly active wallet; does not show old wallet assets

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement the code changes in the files above.
- List exactly what files changed and a short summary of each change.
- No unrelated refactors.
