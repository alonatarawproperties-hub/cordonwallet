FIX MVP: REMOVE PLACEHOLDERS IN SEND + ACTIVITY (REAL ON-CHAIN)

Context:
- Wallet + balances are now real (I can fund with MATIC and see it).
- BUT Activity/history is still placeholder.
- Send screen still relies on placeholder balance logic and blocks/doesn’t send.

GOAL:
1) Activity shows REAL transactions (at minimum: outgoing txs we broadcast + optionally inbound funding txs).
2) Send uses REAL balances from RPC and can broadcast native transfers (MATIC) and ERC20 transfers.
3) Remove all remaining placeholder/mock data from Send + Activity + Approvals screens.

A) SEND: make it fully real (no placeholder balance checks)
1) Update Send UI to use real data sources:
   - Use the existing real balance fetchers in /packages/core (native + ERC20).
   - The “available balance” displayed and validations MUST come from RPC (bigint/raw) not placeholder numbers.
2) Validation rules:
   - For native send: ensure amount + estimatedFee <= nativeBalance.
   - For ERC20: ensure amount <= tokenBalance.
   - If fee estimate fails, allow retry; show friendly error.
3) Wire confirm action to real send module:
   - sendNative(...) for MATIC/ETH/BNB (native)
   - sendERC20(...) for ERC20 transfers
4) On success:
   - Show real tx hash
   - Show “View on Explorer”
   - Immediately log it into local tx history (see section B)

B) ACTIVITY: replace placeholders with real history
Implement a real Activity data source with two layers:

Layer 1 (MUST): Local broadcast log (always works)
1) Create /packages/core/src/activity/store.ts:
   - saveTx(TxRecord)
   - listTxs({address, chainId}) sorted desc
   TxRecord = { hash, chainId, address, direction:'out', kind:'native'|'erc20', tokenAddress?, to, amount, createdAt, status:'pending'|'confirmed'|'failed' }

2) After sendNative/sendERC20 succeeds, call saveTx().

3) Add a receipt poller:
   - For any pending tx in the log, periodically check getTransactionReceipt(hash).
   - Update status to confirmed/failed when receipt arrives.

4) Replace Activity screen placeholder list with listTxs() + status badges + explorer links.

Layer 2 (OPTIONAL but recommended): Show inbound funding txs without API keys
Because user funded MATIC and expects to see it:
- Implement “Recent inbound scan” for native transfers by scanning the last N blocks:
  - Get latest blockNumber
  - For last N blocks (e.g. 50–200 max), fetch block with transactions (includeTransactions:true)
  - Filter tx where tx.to == activeAddress
  - Add these as direction:'in' activity items (store in cache; do NOT duplicate if already present)
- This is only used on-demand (pull-to-refresh) to avoid performance issues.

C) APPROVALS: remove placeholder
- If Approvals screen is still mocked, either:
  1) Hide it behind “Coming soon” for MVP, OR
  2) Implement real approvals later.
For now: ensure it does not block Send/Activity functionality.

D) CLEANUP
- Delete or disable any mock/mockData/demo services feeding Send/Activity.
- No setTimeout simulation for “success”.

DONE WHEN:
- I can send 0.001 MATIC to another wallet and get a real tx hash visible on explorer.
- Activity immediately shows that tx as pending then confirmed.
- Pull-to-refresh can show inbound funding txs OR at least shows outgoing history correctly (no placeholder list).
- No placeholder balance numbers remain in Send and Activity.
