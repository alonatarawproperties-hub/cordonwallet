REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (single task):

Goal:
When user is already inside an Asset/Token detail page (ex: ROACHY screen), tapping “Send” must open the Send Form directly with that asset pre-selected (pic3), NOT the asset picker list (pic2). Keep existing behavior (picker list) only when user taps Send from the main wallet/home screen.

What to change:

1) Find the Asset Detail screen “Send” button handler
- Search for the asset page screen file(s):
  - client/screens/*Asset* (AssetDetails / TokenDetails / AssetScreen / TokenScreen)
  - or wherever the “Holdings / History / About” tabs live
- Locate the “Send” button on that screen (likely at bottom).
- It probably does something like navigation.navigate("Send") or opens a Send sheet that starts with token list.
- Change it to pass a route param that includes the selected asset.

Implement:
- On Asset detail page, call:
  navigation.navigate("Send", {
    presetAsset: {
      id: asset.id ?? asset.mint ?? asset.address,
      symbol: asset.symbol,
      name: asset.name,
      chain: asset.chain,              // "solana" | "evm"
      mint: asset.mint,                // for solana tokens
      address: asset.address,          // for evm tokens
      decimals: asset.decimals,
      logo: asset.logo,
      balance: asset.balance,
      usdValue: asset.usdValue,
    }
  });

(If your navigation structure is nested like SendStack, use:
  navigation.navigate("SendStack", { screen: "Send", params: { presetAsset: {...} } })
Adjust to match your app’s navigator names.)

2) Update Send screen to support “presetAsset” and skip the picker step
- Find Send screen(s):
  - client/screens/SendScreen.tsx OR client/screens/Send/*.tsx
- Identify how the Send flow currently works:
  - Step A: show token list (picker) (pic2)
  - Step B: show send form (recipient + amount) (pic3)
- Add support for route.params.presetAsset.
- If presetAsset exists:
  - Set selectedAsset/token immediately
  - Set the UI state/step directly to the Send Form
  - DO NOT render the picker list first

Pseudo-implementation (adapt to your code):
- At top of Send screen:
  const route = useRoute();
  const presetAsset = route.params?.presetAsset;

- If you have state like:
  const [selectedAsset, setSelectedAsset] = useState(null);
  const [step, setStep] = useState("picker"); // or similar

- Add:
  useEffect(() => {
    if (presetAsset) {
      setSelectedAsset(presetAsset);
      setStep("form"); // whatever your form step is called
    }
  }, [presetAsset?.id]);

- If your Send screen derives token list from portfolio hook:
  - If presetAsset exists but the asset isn’t loaded yet, still allow form to render using presetAsset (do not block on list).
  - When portfolio data arrives, you can “hydrate” it by matching id/mint/address and replacing selectedAsset with the full object.

3) Make sure back behavior is correct
- From asset page → send form → back should return to asset page.
- Don’t replace the route unless you intentionally want that. Prefer navigate() not reset().
- If you used nested stacks, ensure back pops correctly.

4) Update navigation param typing (if using TS)
- Update your navigation param list:
  Send: { presetAsset?: PresetAssetType }
- Add/extend the type used by Send screen.

5) Quick manual test checklist
- Open ROACHY asset detail → tap Send → should open Send form with ROACHY already selected (no picker list).
- From Home main “Send” button → still shows picker list (pic2).
- Deep links / other entry points should not break.

Deliverable:
- Commit changes in the asset detail screen + send screen + navigation typing (if TS) so this behavior works consistently.
