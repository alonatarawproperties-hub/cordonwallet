Make a minimal, safe patch ONLY in client/lib/solana/swapSecurity.ts to stop false “Blocked for safety: unexpected program detected …” caused by VersionedTransaction v0 Address Lookup Tables (LUT) not being resolved. Do NOT refactor or touch other swap code. Keep existing return shape and UI behavior. Only change how program IDs are extracted and when blocking triggers.

CURRENT BUG:
decodeAndValidateSwapTx() uses message.staticAccountKeys only. For v0 transactions with addressTableLookups, many accounts/programIds are not in static keys; programIdIndex resolution becomes unreliable, causing random program ids to be marked unknown and blocked.

PATCH REQUIREMENTS:
1) Detect LUT usage:
   - const hasLuts = !!message.addressTableLookups && message.addressTableLookups.length > 0;
2) If hasLuts is true:
   - Do NOT try to validate program IDs against ALLOWED_PROGRAM_IDS because we cannot resolve LUT keys in pure client without RPC calls.
   - Do NOT push anything to unknownPrograms based on ALLOWED_PROGRAM_IDS for these txs.
   - Do NOT trigger the blocking error based on unknownPrograms for these txs.
   - Instead add a warning:
     "Tx uses address lookup tables; client cannot fully verify program allowlist. Validation will be handled server-side."
3) If hasLuts is false (legacy/static-only tx):
   - Keep existing behavior exactly (program allowlist enforcement stays).
4) Fee payer:
   - If hasLuts is false keep existing fee payer check.
   - If hasLuts is true: do NOT push a fee payer mismatch error; instead warn:
     "Fee payer cannot be fully verified client-side for LUT transactions."
5) Keep existing “No Jupiter/Pump program detected” warnings but ensure they don’t become blocking. If hasLuts is true, change that check to only warn and phrase it:
   "Route program not detected in static keys (LUT tx); this can be normal."
6) Ensure safe is computed as (errors.length === 0) as before.
7) Make smallest diff possible; no new files.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Add `hasLuts` near after message is defined.
- Wrap these blocks with `if (!hasLuts) { ...existing allowlist + fee payer mismatch + block line... } else { ...warnings... }`
- Keep collecting programIds from static keys for display/debug even in LUT case, but DO NOT mark unknown/blocked from them.
- Do not change constants files.

After patch, pump swaps should no longer be blocked on “unexpected program” for Jupiter v0/LUT txs.
