You are working on Cordon (Expo RN). Fix swap failures when input is NOT SOL (e.g., USDC→SOL) due to missing SOL fee buffer. The app currently reserves “Spendable SOL” when swapping FROM SOL, but it does NOT enforce/communicate the required SOL buffer when swapping FROM tokens, causing Jupiter swaps to fail (often showing 0x1788 / route failure) when the wallet has insufficient SOL for tx fees + WSOL rent.

GOAL
1) Always compute and enforce a required SOL buffer for ANY swap, even when input is USDC/SPL/Token-2022.
2) If user SOL balance is below required buffer, disable Swap and show a themed warning (“Not enough SOL to cover network fees and temporary WSOL/rent”).
3) Keep existing working swap logic; only add checks + UX. No breaking changes.
4) MAX button behavior:
   - For SOL input: keep existing “spendable” logic.
   - For token input (USDC, etc): MAX can still set full token balance, BUT must block swap if SOL buffer is insufficient and show the warning. (Do NOT subtract buffer from token amount—fees are paid in SOL.)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Add a shared helper to estimate required SOL buffer:
   - Create client/utils/solFeeBuffer.ts (or similar).
   - Export async function estimateRequiredSolLamportsForSwap({ connection, speedMode, needsWsolTempAccount, mayCreateAta }): number
   - Use:
     - baseTxLamports = 10000 (safe base)
     - priorityLamports depends on speedMode:
         Standard: 800000  (0.0008 SOL)
         Fast:     2000000 (0.002 SOL)
         Turbo:    5000000 (0.005 SOL)
     - rentExemptLamportsForTokenAcct = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(165)
     - If needsWsolTempAccount true → include 1 * rentExemptLamportsForTokenAcct
     - If mayCreateAta true → include 1 * rentExemptLamportsForTokenAcct
     - Return baseTxLamports + priorityLamports + rent parts + small safety cushion (e.g. + 20000 lamports)

B) Determine flags for the current swap:
   - If output is SOL OR input is SOL, Jupiter often uses WSOL internally; to be safe:
       needsWsolTempAccount = (outputMint is SOL) OR (inputMint is SOL)
     (This is conservative but prevents false negatives.)
   - mayCreateAta:
       - if outputMint is NOT SOL, check if user already has the output token account.
       - If we already have token accounts cached in state, use that.
       - Otherwise do a lightweight check: findAssociatedTokenAddress and connection.getAccountInfo(ata) to see if exists.
       - If it doesn't exist, set mayCreateAta = true.

C) Apply this in the Swap screen:
   - Locate the swap UI screen/component that handles amount input, MAX, and the Swap button (search “Swap”, “Speed Mode”, “Standard/Fast/Turbo”, “MAX”).
   - Add state:
       requiredSolLamports
       hasEnoughSolForFees
   - Whenever (inputMint, outputMint, speedMode, walletSolBalance) changes, recompute requiredSolLamports and hasEnoughSolForFees.
   - Render a themed warning card if !hasEnoughSolForFees:
       Title: “Not enough SOL for fees”
       Body: “This swap requires ~X SOL for network fees + temporary WSOL/rent. Add SOL to continue.”
     Use the app theme colors (danger/warning), not default gray modal styles.

D) Disable Swap button when:
   - invalid amount OR quote missing OR loading OR !hasEnoughSolForFees
   - Also ensure Review/Confirm modals cannot proceed when !hasEnoughSolForFees (early return with the same warning).

E) Improve error mapping:
   - In the swap execution error handler (client side), if error/log indicates:
       “insufficient funds”, “insufficient lamports”, “rent”, “0x1788” immediately after Route
     then show the same user-friendly message:
       “Swap failed: Not enough SOL to cover network fees / temporary account rent.”
   - Keep raw error logs for debugging, but user sees friendly message.

F) Testing checklist (do these before finishing):
   1) Wallet with 0 SOL and some USDC → attempt USDC→SOL:
        - Swap button disabled + warning shown.
   2) Wallet with small SOL below threshold (e.g. 0.0003) → warning.
   3) Wallet with enough SOL (>= computed) → swap allowed.
   4) SOL→USDC still shows “Spendable” and MAX respects buffer (existing behavior unchanged).
   5) UI uses theme colors for warning card and any modal (no off-theme gray).

Deliverable:
- Commit changes with clear comments.
- Do NOT modify server swap routing; this is purely UX/validation to prevent “mystery Jupiter failures” from insufficient SOL buffer.

Start now: find the swap screen, implement helper, wire it up, and verify with the above tests.
