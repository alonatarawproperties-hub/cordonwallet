STEP 4: IMPLEMENT REAL SEND (SIGN + BROADCAST) — EVM ONLY

Prereqs:
- Wallet core is real + persisted (done)
- RPC clients + balance fetchers are real (Step 3)

GOAL:
User can send native and ERC20 tokens and receive a REAL tx hash that appears on the correct explorer.
Remove all send placeholders (setTimeout / fake success).

A) Core transaction module (packages/core)
Create /packages/core/src/tx/send.ts with:

1) sendNative({
  chainId,
  fromWalletId (or from address resolved from active wallet),
  to: `0x${string}`,
  amountNative: string (decimal, e.g. "0.01"),
}) -> returns { hash, chainId, explorerUrl }

Implementation details:
- Validate 'to' address (0x + checksum optional)
- Convert amountNative -> bigint using viem parseEther/parseUnits based on chain native decimals (18)
- Create a wallet client using viem with the account derived from the stored secret (mnemonic/private key)
- Estimate gas, get maxFeePerGas/maxPriorityFeePerGas if supported; otherwise fallback to gasPrice
- Send transaction using walletClient.sendTransaction
- Return real tx hash + explorer link (from registry)

2) sendERC20({
  chainId,
  fromWalletId,
  tokenAddress: `0x${string}`,
  to: `0x${string}`,
  amount: string (decimal, e.g. "12.5"),
}) -> returns { hash, chainId, explorerUrl }

Implementation details:
- Read token decimals (from token list; if missing, call decimals() once and cache)
- Encode ERC20 transfer(to, amount) via viem encodeFunctionData
- Estimate gas and send via walletClient.sendTransaction({ to: tokenAddress, data, value: 0n })

B) Gas + UX
- Add “Fee estimate” in UI:
  - show estimated fee in native token (approx is fine)
- If estimation fails, show friendly error with retry option.
- Never show raw RPC errors to users; map to human-friendly.

C) Wire mobile Send screens to real tx module
- Remove any placeholder send service.
- On confirm:
  1) (for now) show a simple “Review & Send” screen
  2) call sendNative or sendERC20
  3) show success screen with:
     - tx hash (copy)
     - “View on Explorer” link
- On failure: show error toast/banner.

D) Minimal local Activity logging (required for MVP)
- After sending succeeds, save a record locally (SecureStore or local storage):
  TxRecord = { id, chainId, walletAddress, hash, type: 'native'|'erc20', tokenAddress?, to, amount, createdAt }
- Activity screen must render from this log (even if status is unknown at first).

E) Verification mode: testnet support
- Ensure this works on testnets if USE_TESTNETS=true (recommended during dev).
- Explorer links must match chain config.

DONE WHEN:
- A real native send returns a real tx hash visible on explorer
- A real ERC20 send returns a real tx hash visible on explorer
- Activity screen shows the tx immediately after send
- No setTimeout/fake send placeholders remain anywhere
