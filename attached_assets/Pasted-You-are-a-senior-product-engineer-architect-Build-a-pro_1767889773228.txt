You are a senior product engineer + architect. Build a production-grade EVM-only non-custodial wallet as a monorepo with a mobile native app + web dashboard + lightweight backend API.

GOAL (INVESTOR / USER WOW FACTOR)
We are NOT building “another wallet”. Our differentiators:
1) Wallet Firewall: explain-before-sign + enforceable policies (block risky actions by default).
2) Bundles: multi-wallet management with safe batch operations.
3) AI Explainer: plain-English transaction explanation + risk reasons (never uses private keys).
Phase 2 (not required now but must be architecturally supported): Vaults (EVM multisig via Safe).

PHASE 1 SCOPE: EVM ONLY
- Support Ethereum-style accounts (0x addresses) and EVM networks only.
- MVP networks enabled by default: Polygon, BNB Chain, Ethereum.
- Architecture must make adding more EVM networks configuration-only (RPC + chainId + explorer URLs).

NON-CUSTODIAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
- NEVER store or transmit seed phrases or private keys to backend.
- Keys must be generated/imported and stored ONLY on-device.
- Use secure storage: iOS Keychain + Android Keystore (via Expo SecureStore or equivalent).
- Require user PIN on first run; support biometrics for unlock.
- Any sensitive local data must be encrypted with a key derived from PIN (and secured in Keychain/Keystore).
- Backend is for metadata only (token lists, price cache, risk hints). It must not be relied on for security decisions.

TECH STACK (MUST)
Monorepo with pnpm:
- Mobile: React Native (Expo)
- Web: Next.js (App Router)
- API: Node.js + Fastify (TypeScript)
- DB: Postgres (only non-sensitive metadata)
- EVM interaction: viem (preferred)
- WalletConnect v2 for dApp connections

MONOREPO STRUCTURE (MUST)
/apps/mobile       (Expo RN)
/apps/web          (Next.js)
/services/api      (Fastify)
/packages/core     (shared TS: chain config, tx decoding, policy engine, types)
/packages/ui       (shared UI kit/components/tokens for consistent design)

CORE MVP FEATURES (PHASE 1)

A) WALLET CORE (MUST)
- Create wallet (seed phrase generation, show once with backup warning)
- Import wallet (seed phrase + private key import)
- Address/QR display, copy address
- Balances: native + ERC20 token balances per network
- Send/Receive native and ERC20
- Transaction history (via RPC + explorer fallback where needed)
- Network switcher (Polygon, BSC, Ethereum)

B) FIREWALL V1 (MUST — MAIN DIFFERENTIATOR)
Every signing request (send/swap/approve/dApp tx) must show a “Before you sign” preview sheet that includes:
- Action type (Approve / Transfer / Swap / Contract Interaction)
- You pay / You receive (when determinable)
- Destination / Spender address + explorer link
- Token approval amount (detect Unlimited approvals)
- Estimated gas fee
- Risk summary: Low/Medium/High with bullet reasons (rule-based first; pluggable later)
- Policy result: Allowed / Blocked
Policies (enforced, not just warnings):
1) Block unlimited approvals by default (offer “cap allowance” suggestion)
2) Max spend per transaction
3) Daily spend limit
4) Allowlist / denylist contracts and spender addresses
Override behavior:
- If blocked, require an “I understand” checkbox + an “Override (Danger)” action with extra confirmation.

C) AI TRANSACTION EXPLAINER (MUST — RETAIL WOW)
- Given decoded tx + preview data (NO keys), generate:
  - Plain-English explanation
  - “What could go wrong?” in 2–4 bullets
  - Safer alternative suggestion where applicable (e.g., “use capped allowance”)
- Must be fast and readable. If AI is unavailable, fall back to rule-based text.

D) BUNDLES + MULTI-WALLET (MUST — SECOND DIFFERENTIATOR)
- Manage multiple wallets inside one app
- Create Bundles (group wallets under a name)
- Portfolio rollup per bundle and total
- Safe batch actions (limited and guarded by policies):
  1) Distribute gas (send small native token amounts to multiple wallets)
  2) Batch send token (with max cap per wallet + total cap)
- Approvals Dashboard (EVM):
  - List token approvals by spender
  - One-tap revoke (build safe flow; show costs and confirm)

E) dAPP CONNECTIVITY (MUST)
- WalletConnect v2 session management
- dApp browser (basic) or “Connect” experience that works for common dApps
- For any dApp tx, MUST go through Firewall preview before signing

F) BACKEND (LIGHTWEIGHT, MVP)
Provide endpoints for:
- Token metadata list per chain (symbol, decimals, logo URL optional)
- Price feed abstraction (can be stubbed with placeholders but must have clean interfaces)
- Risk hint endpoint (placeholder) that can later integrate external providers
- Rate limiting + logging + health check
No authentication required beyond basic app instance ID; store only non-sensitive preferences.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW STRICTLY)
Design style: minimalist, professional fintech. Clean spacing, strong hierarchy, safety-first tone.
Avoid: neon, heavy gradients, meme visuals, “casino” crypto vibe, cluttered dashboards.

DESIGN SYSTEM
- Layout: 8px spacing grid. Standard paddings: 16/24.
- Typography:
  - System font stack on mobile; Inter on web if available.
  - Headings: 24/20/18; Body: 16; Caption: 12–13.
- Radius: 12 (cards/sheets), 10 (inputs), 999 (pills).
- Elevation: subtle shadow only on modals/bottom sheets; otherwise flat with borders.
- Icons: simple line icons (Lucide or similar), consistent stroke.

COLOR TOKENS (USE EXACTLY)
Neutral base + single accent:
- Background: Dark #0B0F14, Light #FFFFFF
- Surface/Card: Dark #111827, Light #F7F8FA
- Border: Dark #1F2937, Light #E5E7EB
- Text Primary: Dark #F9FAFB, Light #0B0F14
- Text Secondary: Dark #A1A1AA, Light #6B7280
- Accent: #3B82F6
- Success: #22C55E
- Warning: #F59E0B
- Danger: #EF4444

REUSABLE COMPONENTS (SHARED UI KIT)
- Button (primary, secondary, ghost, destructive)
- Input (label, helper, error)
- Card
- List row (title, subtitle, right value, chevron)
- Badge (neutral/success/warn/danger)
- Modal + Bottom sheet
- Toast notifications
- Skeleton loaders
- Empty state component

NAV / INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
Bottom tabs (mobile) / left nav (web):
1) Portfolio
2) Activity
3) Browser (dApps)
4) Bundles
5) Settings
Vaults (Phase 2): show as “Vaults (Beta)” under Bundles or Settings, but DO NOT implement in Phase 1 unless time allows.

CORE MVP SCREENS (MUST IMPLEMENT)
1) Onboarding (Create / Import)
2) Backup warning + seed display (create only)
3) Secure Unlock (PIN + biometrics)
4) Portfolio (total + assets)
5) Asset detail (holdings + actions)
6) Send
7) Receive
8) Swap (simple UI; can be stubbed behind interface if routing not ready)
9) Activity list
10) Transaction detail
11) dApp Browser + WalletConnect Sessions
12) Firewall Preview Sheet (before signing)
13) Policy Settings (limits, allow/deny lists, approvals behavior)
14) Approvals Dashboard (revoke)
15) Wallet Manager (multiple wallets)
16) Bundles (create/edit + rollup + batch actions)
17) Settings (security, networks, help)

FIREWALL PREVIEW UI (VERY IMPORTANT)
A bottom sheet titled “Before you sign” showing:
- Action type
- You pay / You receive
- Spender/contract/destination with explorer link
- Highlight “Unlimited approval” in Danger
- Risk summary (Low/Medium/High) + bullet reasons
- Policy status (Allowed/Blocked) and reason
Buttons:
- Sign (primary)
- Reject (secondary)
If Blocked: Sign is disabled until user checks “I understand” and then presses “Override (Danger)” + confirms.

QUALITY / DELIVERABLES
- Provide working dev setup commands for mobile/web/api
- Provide .env templates for each app/service
- Implement minimal tests for:
  - policy engine
  - tx decode/preview generation
- Clean error handling (never show raw RPC errors)
- Loading states everywhere + empty states
- No TODO placeholders in core flows: create/import, preview+policy, sign+send, bundle creation, approvals revoke.

PHASE 2 (ROADMAP ONLY — DO NOT BUILD NOW, BUT DESIGN FOR IT)
- Vaults: EVM multisig via Safe integration
- Batch transactions with per-wallet simulation
- “Rescue Center” panic mode (revoke all approvals, safe transfer guidance)
- Add more EVM networks by config
- Later: add Solana support as Phase 3

Start by scaffolding the monorepo, shared core + UI kit, then implement end-to-end wallet create/import → portfolio → send → firewall preview → sign → activity. After that add WalletConnect + browser, then bundles + approvals dashboard, then policy settings, then web dashboard parity.
