You are modifying a production codebase. DO NOT refactor, DO NOT rename unrelated types, DO NOT “clean up”. Make minimal, targeted changes only.

Goal:
1) Arbitrum (chainId 42161) must display the ARBITRUM CHAIN logo (not ETH) anywhere a CHAIN badge/icon is shown.
2) ETH can remain the native symbol for Arbitrum (that’s correct), but the chain badge/icon must use Arbitrum branding.
3) The top chain icon row (filters) must include Arbitrum as its own chain chip/icon, like Trust Wallet.

IMPORTANT CONCEPT:
- “Chain logo” != “native token logo”
- Arbitrum chain uses ETH as gas, but chain identity/logo must be Arbitrum.

Step A — Add Arbitrum to chain logo mapping (this is missing now)
File: client/lib/token-logos.ts
Function: getChainLogoUrl(chainId)
Add chainId 42161 mapping.
Use a stable public logo URL OR a local bundled asset fallback.

Use this URL (works well in production):
"42161": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/arbitrum/info/logo.png"

Keep existing mappings unchanged.

Step B — Ensure UI uses CHAIN LOGO for chain badges, not native token symbol
Search for any logic like:
- getAssetLogoUrl(...) being used for chain badge
- using nativeSymbol ("ETH") to decide the chain icon
- any conditional like: if nativeSymbol === "ETH" show ethereum logo

In these screens/components (likely):
- client/screens/ManageCryptoScreen.tsx
- client/screens/ReceiveScreen.tsx (or whatever renders the top chain icon row)
- any component rendering the chain pill/badge (search for “Arbitrum”, “chain badge”, “chain icon”, “getChainLogoUrl”, “nativeSymbol”)

Fix rule:
- If it’s a CHAIN label/pill/badge/icon → use getChainLogoUrl(chainId) (chainId=42161 => arbitrum logo)
- If it’s a TOKEN icon (USDC/USDT/etc) → use token.logoURI first, else token icon resolver

Do NOT change token display behavior except chain badges.

Step C — Add Arbitrum to the top chain filter/icon row
In ManageCryptoScreen, there’s a top row with ETH / POL / BNB / SOL.
Update the data source that generates those chips to include Arbitrum.
Do NOT hardcode “ETH” as a chain chip for arbitrum.
Add an “ARB”/Arbitrum chip:
- label: "ARB" or "ETH" is NOT correct for chain chip. Use "ARB" (chain shorthand) or "Arbitrum".
- chainId: 42161
- icon: getChainLogoUrl(42161)

Same for Receive screen (top chain icons row). Add Arbitrum icon there too.

Step D — Defensive fallback
If getChainLogoUrl returns null, fallback to a generic globe icon (existing behavior), but for Arbitrum it must not be null after step A.

Step E — Verify
After changes:
1) “ETH Arbitrum” row should show Arbitrum chain logo (not Ethereum logo) in the small chain badge.
2) The top chain icon row should include Arbitrum as its own icon.
3) Token icons (USDC, USDT etc) should still show token logoURI when available.

Deliverables:
- Commit minimal code changes only.
- Print the exact file+line edits you made.
- Do not touch unrelated code.
