We’re building a scripted demo on the WEBSITE (not real blockchain), but we need the MOBILE app to produce the exact assets + flows so the website demo matches the real app UI.

TASK A — ADD “DEMO MODE” (safe, no mainnet changes)
1) Add a Settings toggle: “Demo Mode (for website demo)”
   - Default OFF
   - When ON:
     - Show a new menu item in Settings: “Export Demo Assets”
     - Show a new hidden route/screen: Demo Flow Preview (Step 1–6)
   - When OFF: hide these demo-only items.

2) Demo Flow Preview screen (scripted inside mobile)
Create a screen that shows the same 6 steps we want to show on the website demo:
  Step 1: Connect dApp sheet (Roachy Games verified)
  Step 2: Sign Message sheet (shows raw long message)
  Step 3: Sign Transaction + Firewall Review (Low Risk example)
  Step 4: Approvals screen (show at least 2 approvals, one flagged/unlimited)
  Step 5: Revoke / Cap flow (show revoke confirmation state)
  Step 6: Success / Transaction Sent screen

IMPORTANT:
- These are VISUAL/DEMO states only. Do not broadcast or sign real transactions.
- Use the same UI components/screens you already have, but drive them with demo data.

TASK B — EXPORT WEBSITE DEMO ASSETS
We need clean screenshots for the website demo. Implement ONE-TAP export:

1) Create a function “Capture Demo Screenshots”
- Automatically navigates through Step 1–6 screens
- Captures a screenshot per step (high quality)
- Saves them to the device (or share sheet) using Expo capabilities

Output filenames EXACTLY:
  01_connect.png
  02_sign_message.png
  03_sign_tx_low_risk.png
  04_approvals.png
  05_revoke.png
  06_success.png

2) Also export:
- cordon_logo.png (transparent)
- optional short recordings (3–6s each) if easy:
  demo_connect.mp4, demo_firewall.mp4, demo_revoke.mp4

TASK C — MAKE DEMO DATA MATCH PRODUCT COPY
Hardcode demo data that looks realistic:
- dApp Name: Roachy Games
- Domain: roachy.games
- Verified badge ON
- Networks: show Solana + EVM options on connect sheet
- For sign message: show the real long message string we currently receive (raw)
- For approvals: include at least one “Unlimited approval blocked” example + one normal approval
- For firewall: show “Low Risk: simple SPL transfer via official program” for Solana transfer example
- For revoke: show “Revoked successfully” state

DONE WHEN
- Demo Mode toggle exists and works
- Demo Flow Preview shows all 6 steps consistently
- “Export Demo Assets” produces the 6 PNG files with exact names
- Export uses a share sheet or saves to Photos so I can move them to /public/demo on the website
- No changes impact mainnet wallet functionality when Demo Mode is OFF
