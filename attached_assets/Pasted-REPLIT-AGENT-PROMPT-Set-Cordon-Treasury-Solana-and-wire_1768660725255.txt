REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — Set “Cordon Treasury” (Solana) and wire it to success-fee + Settings (OTA-safe)

Treasury Label: Cordon Treasury
Solana Treasury Address:
6pcN26cpKbWmGyRn8DgRjqRzpBW2CFp8PK5wZ9gTArpE

GOAL
Use a single Solana treasury (open beta) for collecting success fees, and display it in Settings with Copy. Must work for BOTH native builds and OTA updates (no env crashes).

DO NOT
- Do not touch swap routing, Jupiter logic, quote refresh logic, security blocking, or server swap endpoints.
- Do not refactor navigation.
- Do not store any private keys anywhere.

STEP 1 — Add to app config (OTA-safe)
If app.config.ts exists: update it.
If not, create app.config.ts and mirror existing app.json config exactly, then add extra fields.

Add under `extra`:
  cordonTreasuryName: "Cordon Treasury",
  cordonSolTreasury: "6pcN26cpKbWmGyRn8DgRjqRzpBW2CFp8PK5wZ9gTArpE",

Keep existing:
- updates.url
- runtimeVersion policy
- everything else unchanged

STEP 2 — Central accessor (single source of truth)
Create: client/constants/treasury.ts

Implement:
- export const CORDON_TREASURY_NAME = "Cordon Treasury";
- export function getCordonSolTreasury(): string
  - Read from expo constants (try all):
    Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.cordonSolTreasury
    (Constants as any).manifest2?.extra?.cordonSolTreasury
    (Constants as any).manifest?.extra?.cordonSolTreasury
  - Fallback to the literal address if missing (never crash prod).
  - Validate:
      try { new PublicKey(addr); return addr; } catch { return ""; }
  - If invalid: dev-only console.warn, return empty string.

STEP 3 — Wire recipient for success fee
Find where the post-confirmation “success fee” SOL transfer is constructed (successFeeService / swap confirmation handler).
- Replace any hardcoded destination with:
    const treasury = getCordonSolTreasury();
    if (!treasury) { skip charging + dev warn; }
    else use treasury as recipient.

Also update any UI strings around the fee to mention:
- “Success fee goes to Cordon Treasury.”

IMPORTANT:
- If treasury is invalid/missing, do NOT block swap. Just skip fee and show dev-only warning.

STEP 4 — Settings UI row (public display)
In the Settings screen component (where the gear header leads; e.g. client/screens/Settings*.tsx):
Add a small row/card:

Label: "Cordon Treasury"
Value: shortened address like "6pcN…ArpE"
Actions: Copy button (copies full address)
Optional: “View on Explorer” button (opens solscan URL) — optional, not required.

Styling:
- Match existing monochrome theme.
- Keep it minimal.

STEP 5 — Quick QA checklist
- App loads fine via OTA even if env vars are missing.
- Swap success fee destination is the treasury address.
- Settings shows “Cordon Treasury” row with copy working.
- No crashes if config is missing (fallback works).

DELIVERABLE
- app.config.ts updated (or created) with extra.cordonSolTreasury + extra.cordonTreasuryName
- client/constants/treasury.ts created
- success fee code uses getCordonSolTreasury()
- Settings row added
