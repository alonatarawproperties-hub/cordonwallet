Implement a premium Splash / Boot experience for Cordon that preloads only what’s necessary, initializes core services, and shows a clean lightweight animation while booting. This must work in Expo Go and must never hang indefinitely.

GOAL
- Cold start feels polished (no white flashes)
- App routes correctly (Onboarding vs Unlock vs Home)
- Critical services are warmed up (WalletConnect, chain registry, RPC clients)
- Minimal preloading (fast), with safe fallbacks
- Add a subtle “shield” style animation during boot (no heavy Lottie required unless already installed)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Never block forever: strict timeouts + Retry
- Do NOT fetch balances on splash (do that after Home mounts)
- Mainnet only behavior remains unchanged

------------------------------------------------------------
A) WHAT TO PRELOAD (ONLY ESSENTIAL)
1) UI assets:
- App logo (Cordon emblem)
- Tab icons used on first render
- Primary font(s) if custom fonts are used; otherwise skip font loading

2) Core initialization (fast, no network required):
- Load chain registry config (EVM + Solana)
- Prepare RPC client factories (do not ping multiple chains)
- Initialize WalletConnect client and restore sessions from storage
- Load user settings (theme, firewall defaults, last selected chain, last active wallet id)

3) Security state:
- Check if encrypted vault exists
- Determine initial route:
  - No vault -> Onboarding (Create/Import)
  - Vault exists -> Unlock screen (PIN/biometric)
  - If already unlocked session in-memory (rare after hot reload) -> Home

4) Light health checks (non-blocking, single target):
- Ping ONLY the last-selected chain’s RPC (or fallback to Solana mainnet) with a short timeout (1.2s)
- If ping fails, set a “degraded network” flag and proceed anyway (show banner later)

------------------------------------------------------------
B) SPLASH SCREEN UI + ANIMATION (LIGHTWEIGHT)
Create a Splash/Boot screen with:
- Centered logo
- Subtle animation:
  Option 1 (preferred): pulse + slight rotate shimmer on logo using React Native Animated (no extra libs)
  Option 2: simple progress bar that fills while steps complete

Animation rules:
- 60fps friendly, no heavy assets
- Stops immediately when boot completes
- If boot takes >2.5s show text: “Securing your wallet…”
- If boot takes >4s show a “Retry” button and “Diagnostics” small link (shows which step is stuck)

------------------------------------------------------------
C) BOOTSTRAP ARCHITECTURE
Create /packages/core/src/app/bootstrap.ts

export type BootResult = {
  hasVault: boolean,
  initialRoute: 'Onboarding'|'Unlock'|'Home',
  restoredSessionsCount: number,
  degraded: { chainKey: string, reason: string }[],
  timings: Record<string, number>
}

export async function bootstrapApp(onProgress?: (step: string, pct: number) => void): Promise<BootResult>

Steps inside bootstrapApp (in this exact order):
1) preloadAssets (logo/icons/fonts if needed)
2) initSettings (firewall defaults, last chain, ui prefs)
3) initChainRegistry (EVM + Solana entries)
4) initWalletConnect + restore sessions
5) checkVaultExists + set initialRoute
6) pingLastSelectedRPC (timeout 1200ms) -> if fails mark degraded, do not throw

Each step must:
- report progress (step name + percent)
- have its own timeout guard (e.g., 1500–2500ms depending step)
- fail gracefully and continue where safe

------------------------------------------------------------
D) ROUTING + FAILSAFES
- Splash calls bootstrapApp()
- Navigate based on BootResult.initialRoute
- Must never hang:
  - global watchdog timer 6s:
    - show Retry button
    - Retry re-runs bootstrapApp
  - show minimal diagnostics: which step failed + last error message (dev mode only)

------------------------------------------------------------
E) POST-BOOT BEHAVIOR
- After Home mounts:
  - start fetching balances + activity normally
  - if degraded network flag is set:
    - show a dismissible banner: “Network degraded for {chain}. Tap to change RPC.”

------------------------------------------------------------
DONE WHEN
- Cold start shows splash with animation then routes correctly
- WalletConnect sessions are restored automatically
- No balance fetching happens during splash
- App never freezes; Retry always works
- Works in Expo Go

Implement now and keep code clean + minimal.
