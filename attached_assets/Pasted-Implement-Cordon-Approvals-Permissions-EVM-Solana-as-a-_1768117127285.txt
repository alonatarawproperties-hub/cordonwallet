Implement Cordon “Approvals & Permissions” (EVM + Solana) as a real wow-factor security feature.

Context:
Users expect “approvals” but Solana doesn’t have EVM-style allowances. We need:
- EVM: Token Allowances (approve/unlimited/cap/revoke)
- Solana: Permissions = WalletConnect sessions + SPL token delegates (if any)

UI Requirements:
1) Portfolio screen currently has two tabs: Assets | Approvals
Change to:
- Assets | Security
Inside Security, add sub-tabs:
- EVM Approvals
- Solana Permissions
Keep it minimalist and consistent with existing design.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) EVM Approvals (Ethereum/Polygon/BNB mainnet)
Goal: show token allowances (even if created outside Cordon), classify risk, allow revoke/cap.

Features:
1) Summary header card:
- “Approval Risk: Low/Medium/High”
- “Active approvals: X”
- “Unlimited: Y”
- CTA: “Fix risky approvals”

2) Discover approvals (historical + verify current):
- For each supported chain, build (token, spender) pairs:
  - Use explorer APIs if available (Etherscan/Polygonscan/BscScan) to scan tx history for method selector:
    approve: 0x095ea7b3
    (optional) increaseAllowance/decreaseAllowance
  - Or fallback: show only approvals created inside the app if API keys are missing.
- For each (token, spender), query on-chain allowance(owner, spender) via RPC.
- Only display if allowance > 0.
- Mark “Unlimited” if allowance >= (2^255) or close to max uint.

3) Item UI:
- Token icon/symbol + chain badge
- Spender name if resolvable (else “Unknown spender”) + address shortened
- Allowance: Unlimited / Capped (with amount)
- Risk badge:
  - High: unlimited + high value token (USDC/USDT/WETH) OR unknown spender
  - Medium: unlimited but low value token OR inactive long time
  - Low: capped allowance
- Actions:
  - Revoke (set allowance=0)
  - Cap (replace unlimited with user-chosen capped amount)
- For Cap flow:
  - quick presets: “$25 / $100 / $500 / Custom” (or token units)
  - requires signing a new approve tx with the capped amount.

4) Empty state:
- “No EVM approvals found ✅”
- “Approvals appear after using dApps like swaps, staking, NFT mints.”

------------------------------------------------------------
B) Solana Permissions (Mainnet)
Goal: represent Solana “approval-like” controls clearly.

Solana Permissions should have 2 sections:

1) Connected dApps (WalletConnect sessions):
- List active sessions:
  - name + domain + verified/unverified badge + icon
  - “Allowed: view address / request signatures”
  - last used timestamp if available
- Actions:
  - Disconnect (terminate WC session)
  - “Details” view: show session topic, chains, methods, accounts

2) Token Delegates (SPL permissions):
- Query token accounts by owner:
  - getTokenAccountsByOwner (Token Program)
  - (optional) also support Token-2022 if present
- Parse each token account and check:
  - delegate != null OR delegatedAmount > 0
- Display entries:
  - Token mint + symbol if known
  - Delegate address shortened
  - Delegated amount
  - Risk:
    - Medium if delegate exists and is not recognized
    - Low if delegated amount is 0 (edge case) or recognized
- Action:
  - Revoke delegate (SPL Token Revoke instruction)
- Add empty state:
  - “No token delegates found ✅”
  - “Most Solana apps use per-transaction signing instead of approvals.”

3) Solana permissions summary card:
- “Connected dApps: X”
- “Token delegates: Y”
- “Firewall: Active” (tap opens Firewall settings)

------------------------------------------------------------
C) Integrate with Firewall
- When user is about to sign an EVM approve() tx:
  - Firewall screens it, blocks “Unlimited” by default, offers “Cap it” action.
- When user connects a dApp via WalletConnect:
  - Show verified badge logic
  - Show “Firewall is active – signatures are screened.”

------------------------------------------------------------
D) Acceptance Tests
1) Connect any dApp via WalletConnect:
- Shows in Solana Permissions → Connected dApps list
- Disconnect works

2) Create a SOL transfer + sign message:
- Does NOT create Solana delegate (permissions list stays sessions only)

3) If a token delegate exists on Solana:
- It appears and Revoke clears it

4) On EVM chain:
- If user previously approved USDC in another wallet, the tab can discover it (when explorer API keys configured) and show allowance.
- Revoke and Cap work and update UI.

Notes:
- Keep everything mainnet.
- Do not break existing send/swap flows.
- Keep UI minimalist, consistent, and fast.
