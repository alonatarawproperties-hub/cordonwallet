You are working on the Cordon mobile app (React Native / Expo). Implement a TrustWallet-like “Contract security” section inside the Asset Detail → About tab.

CONTEXT
- File: client/screens/AssetDetailScreen.tsx (single file contains tabs + About tab renderer)
- Current About tab only shows: About {token}, Stats, Links
- Goal: Add a detailed “Contract security” card (collapsible) similar to TrustWallet screenshots.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT claim “Scanned by Blockaid” unless we actually integrate Blockaid. For now, show “Scanned” meaning “On-chain scanned” and display a small caption “Based on on-chain checks”.

REQUIREMENTS (UI)
1) In About tab, insert a new section ABOVE “Stats” (or below Links if you prefer, but keep it visible):
   - Section header row: “Contract security” + status pill (“Scanned” when checks loaded successfully, else “Not scanned”)
   - Collapse/expand chevron button on the right
   - When expanded: show a list of security checks in green “Success” rows (like TrustWallet) and also allow “Warning” (yellow) and “Risk” (red) states if detected
   - At the bottom show a small caption: “Scanned using on-chain checks” (NOT Blockaid)

2) Add a second lightweight card (optional but nice): “Honeypot risk”
   - Since we do NOT have Blockaid API, do NOT say “No significant risks found” as a fact.
   - Instead show: “Not available (no external scanner connected)” OR “On-chain checks only” with info icon.

REQUIREMENTS (DATA / LOGIC)
We must compute contract security from on-chain Solana mint + metadata for BOTH SPL Token (Tokenkeg...) and Token-2022.

Create a new local helper in AssetDetailScreen.tsx (or extracted to a small new file if you prefer cleanliness, but keep changes minimal):
- fetchTokenSecurity(mintAddress: string): Promise<TokenSecurityReport>

TokenSecurityReport should include:
- tokenProgram: "SPL" | "TOKEN_2022" | "UNKNOWN"
- scanned: boolean
- checks: Array<{ key: string; label: string; status: "success"|"warning"|"risk"|"unknown"; detail?: string }>

ON-CHAIN CHECKS TO IMPLEMENT
(These are reliable and come from mint account / metadata / token-2022 extensions if present.)

A) Works for SPL + Token-2022 (always attempt):
- “Anyone can trade this token.” -> status success (we cannot truly prove “anyone can trade” without oracle, so rename to “No transfer restrictions detected” and keep it “unknown” unless we can confirm there is NO transfer hook / no permanent delegate / no restricted transfer extension. If not sure, use "unknown".)
- “The token cannot be minted.” -> success if mintAuthority == null, else risk
- “No Freeze Authority found.” -> success if freezeAuthority == null, else warning/risk
- “The token program cannot be closed.” -> for Token-2022: if closeAuthority exists -> warning/risk; for SPL: usually N/A -> show “Not supported” as unknown
- “Name/Symbol/URI immutable.” -> This is metadata-level:
   - If Metaplex metadata exists and isMutable == false => success
   - If metadata missing => unknown
   - If isMutable == true => warning
- “User balance cannot be manipulated.” -> Too strong; rename to “No admin balance controls detected (on-chain)” and set:
   - success for SPL (baseline, no balance controls)
   - for Token-2022: if permanentDelegate extension exists => warning; else success

B) Token-2022 specific checks (only when program == Token-2022; otherwise show unknown or hide):
- “Transfer fee can not be upgraded.” -> if transferFeeConfig exists:
   - if olderTransferFee not changeable / authority null => success
   - if authority present => warning
   If no transfer fee extension => success (“No transfer fee extension”)
- “No external hook contract found.” -> if transferHook extension exists => warning/risk, else success
- “Transferable after purchased.” -> not provable; drop this line or keep as unknown
- “Not considered high risk / not fake token.” -> do NOT claim. Keep out unless we have scanner.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (HOW TO READ CHAIN)
- Use @solana/web3.js Connection already used by the app. Search in repo for an existing Connection instance / RPC helper (e.g. client/services/solana.ts, client/lib/solana.ts, etc.). Reuse it.
- Determine token program by fetching mint account owner:
   - If owner == TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA => SPL
   - If owner == TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb => Token-2022
- Fetch parsed mint info:
   - For SPL: use getParsedAccountInfo(mintPubkey)
   - For Token-2022: getParsedAccountInfo also works but extensions may not be fully parsed; you can:
       1) Use getAccountInfo and decode with @solana/spl-token-2022 if already installed,
       2) If spl-token-2022 decode is not available, still implement the core checks (mintAuthority, freezeAuthority) and mark the extension checks as “unknown” for now.
- Metaplex metadata:
   - If the project already has a tokenInfo fetcher that includes description/links, check if it already queries metadata. If not, implement minimal metadata read (optional):
     - Detect Metaplex metadata PDA and fetch account; parse isMutable if parsing util exists.
     - If parsing is too heavy, set metadata immutability check to unknown for now.

STATE + UX
- Add state:
   - const [securityReport, setSecurityReport] = useState<TokenSecurityReport | null>(null)
   - const [securityLoading, setSecurityLoading] = useState(false)
   - const [securityExpanded, setSecurityExpanded] = useState(true) (default expanded like TrustWallet)
- When About tab becomes active OR when token address changes, load report:
   - setSecurityLoading(true)
   - try fetchTokenSecurity(address)
   - setSecurityReport(result)
   - finally setSecurityLoading(false)

RENDERING
- Add renderContractSecurity() section used inside renderAboutTab().
- Visual design:
   - A card container similar to your existing statsCard style
   - Each check row: icon (✅ / ⚠️ / ❌), a bold “Success/Warning/Risk/Unknown” label OR just show the check label with status color
   - Match your theme colors (use theme.accent / theme.textSecondary / theme.border / theme.backgroundDefault). Don’t hardcode neon greens; follow existing patterns.

ACCURACY RULES
- Do not say “Scanned by Blockaid” anywhere.
- Do not assert “No significant risks found” as a fact.
- If a check is not provable with current on-chain data, mark it “Unknown” with a short detail (“External scanner not connected”).

DELIVERABLE
- Update client/screens/AssetDetailScreen.tsx to include the new Contract Security section in About tab.
- Ensure TypeScript types compile.
- Ensure the UI doesn’t crash if RPC/metadata fetch fails (show “Not scanned” + retry button).
- Provide a quick manual test plan at the end (SPL token, Token-2022 token, missing metadata token).

Now implement this.
