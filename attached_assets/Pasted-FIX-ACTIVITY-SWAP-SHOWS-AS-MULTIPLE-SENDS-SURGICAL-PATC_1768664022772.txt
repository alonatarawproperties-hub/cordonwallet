FIX ACTIVITY “SWAP SHOWS AS MULTIPLE SENDS” — SURGICAL PATCH ONLY

RULES:
- DO NOT touch swap execution (Jupiter/Pump quote, swap tx building, signing, sending).
- ONLY edit server/solana-api.ts in the fallback history parser block (lines ~775-957).
- Goal: Stop DEX swap hops / inner instructions from being shown as multiple "Send" entries.
- Only create Send/Receive entries when the transfer actually involves the user address.

CONTEXT:
Bug happens because fallback parser merges innerInstructions and then defaults unrelated transfers to "send".

CHANGES TO MAKE (MINIMAL):

1) STOP INCLUDING innerInstructions IN fallback parsing
In the fallback block, replace:
  const allInstructions: any[] = [...instructions];
  if (tx.meta.innerInstructions) { ... allInstructions.push(...inner.instructions) ... }

WITH:
  const allInstructions: any[] = [...instructions];
  // IMPORTANT: do NOT include tx.meta.innerInstructions here.
  // Inner instructions from DEX swaps cause hop transfers to be mis-labeled as "Send".

2) SPL TRANSFERS: ONLY ACCEPT IF USER IS INVOLVED (REMOVE DEFAULT SEND)
Inside processSplTransfer(ix), after you resolve:
  authority, sourceOwner, destOwner

ADD THIS GATE:
  const userInvolved =
    sourceOwner === address ||
    destOwner === address ||
    authority === address;
  if (!userInvolved) return false;

Then change the type logic to:
  if (sourceOwner === address || authority === address) type = "send";
  else if (destOwner === address) type = "receive";
  else return false;

REMOVE the old "else type='send' default" branch.

3) SOL TRANSFERS: SKIP IF USER IS NOT SOURCE OR DESTINATION (REMOVE DEFAULT SEND)
In the SOL transfer loop:
Replace:
  let solType: "send" | "receive" = "send";
  if (info.source === address) solType="send";
  else if (info.destination === address) solType="receive";
  solTransfer = {...}

WITH:
  if (info.source !== address && info.destination !== address) continue;
  let solType: "send" | "receive";
  if (info.source === address) solType = "send";
  else solType = "receive";
  solTransfer = {...}

4) DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE
- Keep existing response shape.
- Keep existing mapping in client/screens/ActivityScreen.tsx unchanged.
- Just ensure swaps no longer create multiple “Send” entries from inner hops.

AFTER PATCH:
- Run history for an address that did a swap.
- Expected: you should NOT see multiple “Send -0.4 SOL” spam entries created from inner swap hops.
- You might see fewer entries; that's correct. Only user-involved transfers should remain.
