You are the senior engineer on Cordon (Expo React Native). Implement a “Token Safety Scan” (token sniffer / rug-check style) INSIDE the Swap screen (NOT fees). I want a human-readable, TrustWallet-like experience:

GOALS (Swap UI)
1) Under “YOU RECEIVE” token selector, show a compact Safety strip:
   - Label: “Safety”
   - Badge: ✅ Low / ⚠️ Medium / ❌ High / ❔ Needs deeper scan
   - Subtext: “Scanned by Cordon • just now” (or “5m ago”)
   - Right side: “Rescan” button (small)
   - Tapping the strip opens a modal with full details (reasons list + what each means)

2) Risk Gate before swap:
   - If risk === HIGH → on pressing Swap, show modal “High risk token” with reasons, and require 2-step confirmation:
       Step 1: “I understand the risks”
       Step 2: “Continue anyway”
     Also include “Cancel”
   - If risk === MEDIUM → show 1-step confirm “Proceed”
   - If LOW → no extra modal, proceed
   - If NEEDS_DEEPER_SCAN/UNKNOWN → show a gentle warning modal with “Proceed” (1 step) + “Rescan”

3) Must work for ALL tokens (SPL + Token-2022). Do NOT hardcode USDC.
4) Scans are based primarily on on-chain checks (fast, reliable). External scanners are optional and can be added later.
5) IMPORTANT: Do not touch or change swap fee logic here. This task is ONLY token safety scanning UI + logic + gating.

WHAT TO SCAN (v1 baseline)
A) Token program:
   - SPL Token (Tokenkeg...) OR Token-2022 (TokenzQd...)
B) Mintable:
   - If mintAuthority exists → Warning (mintable)
   - If none → Safe (fixed supply)
C) Freezable:
   - If freezeAuthority exists → Warning
   - If none → Safe
D) Token-2022 extensions:
   - If program is Token-2022 and account data length > base mint size, then extensions exist.
   - If we cannot decode extensions yet, DO NOT show “Unknown” like we’re dumb.
     Show: “Extensions present (not decoded yet)” and badge should be “Needs deeper scan”.
E) OPTIONAL if libs already exist (don’t break build):
   - Metaplex metadata immutability (isMutable / updateAuthority). If mpl-token-metadata lib exists already, implement it. If not, show “Metadata immutability: Not checked (v2)” with “Needs deeper scan” style.

RISK SCORING RULES (simple + explainable)
- Start at LOW
- If mintable OR freezable → MEDIUM (unless both, then HIGH)
- If Token-2022 extensions present and not decoded → NEEDS_DEEPER_SCAN (doesn’t automatically mean risky, just needs deeper scan)
- If BOTH mintable AND freezable → HIGH
- If mint account fetch fails / RPC error → NEEDS_DEEPER_SCAN (with reason “Unable to verify on-chain right now”)
- If route/source is Pump (Pump.fun / pumpportal route shown in UI) THEN add “High volatility (Pump token)” note.
   - Do NOT automatically set HIGH just because pump; set MEDIUM minimum unless already higher.
   - If pump + (mintable or freezable) → HIGH.

CACHE / PERFORMANCE
- Cache scan results per mint in memory + AsyncStorage with timestamp.
- TTL: 10 minutes (if cached and fresh, reuse; “Rescan” bypasses cache).
- Make sure scans do not spam RPC calls while user types amounts.

IMPLEMENTATION IN CODE
Project context:
- There is a Swap screen (you mentioned SwapScreen.tsx earlier). Implement there.
- Keep code clean: create a hook + small UI component.
- Do NOT put everything in SwapScreen; keep it maintainable.

FILES TO ADD/EDIT
1) Add: client/hooks/useTokenSafetyScan.ts
2) Add: client/components/TokenSafetyStrip.tsx
3) Edit: client/screens/SwapScreen.tsx (or whatever file renders Swap UI) to:
   - Determine selected output token mint (YOU RECEIVE)
   - Determine selected input token mint (YOU PAY)
   - Determine route label/source (Jupiter vs Pump)
   - Call useTokenSafetyScan(outputMint, { inputMint, routeSource })
   - Render <TokenSafetyStrip ... />
   - Add risk-gate behavior in handleSwap() before executing swap

LIBS / DEPENDENCIES
- Check package.json.
- If @solana/spl-token is already present, use it for SPL mint decode.
- If @solana/spl-token-2022 is present, use it for Token-2022 mint decode.
- If spl-token-2022 is NOT present, DO NOT add it if it risks breaking; instead implement minimal mint parsing:
   - Determine program by owner (account.owner)
   - For SPL + Token-2022, the base mint layout is same for mintAuthority/freezeAuthority positions. Use Buffer parsing carefully OR use spl-token if installed.
- Use the existing Solana connection/rpc client that app already uses (do not create new connection logic if there is already a shared one).

UI DETAILS (match existing theme)
- Use existing theme/colors/components (ThemedText, theme.accent, etc.)
- Badges:
   - Low: green “Low”
   - Medium: amber “Medium”
   - High: red “High”
   - Needs deeper scan: gray “Needs scan”
- Provide short human text under each check:
   - Mintable:
     - Safe: “No mint authority — supply is fixed”
     - Warning: “Mint authority exists — supply can increase”
   - Freezable:
     - Safe: “No freeze authority — accounts can’t be frozen”
     - Warning: “Freeze authority exists — accounts can be frozen”
   - Token Program:
     - “SPL Token” or “Token-2022 (extended)”
   - Extensions:
     - If present but not decoded: “Extensions present — decoding coming in v2”
   - Metadata:
     - If not checked: “Not checked yet (v2)”

RISK GATE MODALS
- Create a reusable modal in SwapScreen or component.
- Must show:
  - Title: “Safety check”
  - Overall badge
  - “Reasons” list (the same list shown in details modal)
  - Buttons according to risk level as described above.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (DO THESE MANUALLY WITH LOGS)
1) Selecting any SPL token shows scan within 1s and displays correct mintable/freezable status.
2) Token-2022 token shows Token-2022 program + if extensions present but not decoded, shows “Needs scan” (not “Unknown”).
3) Swap press on HIGH risk requires 2-step confirm.
4) Swap press on LOW proceeds normally.
5) Rescan updates “Scanned by Cordon • just now”.
6) No changes to swap fee logic. No changes to transaction building.

NOW IMPLEMENT IT.
- Make minimal, safe changes.
- Add clear TypeScript types.
- Avoid regressions.
- After implementation, print the key diffs/paths and where you inserted TokenSafetyStrip in Swap UI.
