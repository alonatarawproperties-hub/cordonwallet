You are working on Cordon (React Native / Expo). Implement an on-demand “Contract Security” scanner in the Asset Detail > About tab, similar to Trust Wallet, with “Scanned by Cordon” and a last scanned timestamp. Do NOT add any background cron; only scan when the About tab is opened (first time) and when user taps “Rescan” (or pull-to-refresh inside About). Keep changes minimal and scoped.

Context:
- Asset detail screen is one file: client/screens/AssetDetailScreen.tsx
- Tabs are inline: holdings/history/about
- Current renderAboutTab shows About text + Stats + Links.
- There is TokenInfo interface near top with description/marketCap/circulating/total/links.
Goal:
Add a new “Contract Security” section ABOVE “Stats” in About tab that shows:
1) Header row: “Contract Security” + pill “Scanned” (green) when scan ran, or “Not scanned” (gray) before.
2) Subtext: “Scanned by Cordon • {time}” (e.g., “just now”, “5m ago”, “2h ago”) after scan.
3) List of checks as rows (TrustWallet-like):
   - Mintable: Success if mint authority is null, Warning if exists, Unknown if cannot determine
   - Freezable: Success if freeze authority is null, Warning if exists, Unknown if cannot determine
   - Token program: “SPL” or “Token-2022” as a badge, Unknown if cannot determine
   - Metadata immutability: Success if metadata update authority is null, Warning if exists, Unknown if metadata not found or unsupported
   - Extension checks (Token-2022): show “Success” if we can parse extensions and none are risky; “Warning” if TransferFeeConfig exists; “Unknown” if Token-2022 but parsing not implemented
4) A small italic footer in the card: “Based on on-chain checks” and for Unknown items explain: “Unknown = we couldn’t verify this yet (missing metadata or unsupported token program).”
5) Add a “Rescan” button on the right side of the section header (small).

Implementation details:
A) Create a new type:
type SecurityStatus = "success" | "warning" | "unknown";
interface ContractSecurityCheck { key: string; title: string; subtitle?: string; status: SecurityStatus; badgeText?: string; }
interface ContractSecurityResult { checks: ContractSecurityCheck[]; scannedAt: number; }

B) Add state in AssetDetailScreen:
- const [security, setSecurity] = useState<ContractSecurityResult | null>(null);
- const [isScanningSecurity, setIsScanningSecurity] = useState(false);

C) Trigger scan:
- When About tab becomes active, if security is null then run scanContractSecurity().
- Also run scan when user taps “Rescan”.
- IMPORTANT: Do not spam scans on every re-render; guard with state.

D) Where to scan from:
- Add a lightweight RPC call layer using the existing Solana connection already used in the screen (search in file for connection / RPC usage and reuse it).
- Fetch:
  1) Mint account info: getAccountInfo(mint) and detect token program owner:
     - SPL Token program: TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA
     - Token-2022: TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb
  2) Parse mint data:
     - Use @solana/spl-token functions if already installed. Prefer getMint(connection, mintPubkey, "confirmed", programId?) with correct programId.
     - Determine mintAuthority (exists or null) and freezeAuthority (exists or null).
  3) Metadata:
     - If Metaplex token metadata library exists in repo, use it.
     - If not, implement PDA derivation for metadata account:
       metadataPda = findProgramAddressSync(
         [Buffer.from("metadata"), TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(), mint.toBuffer()],
         TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID
       )
       TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID = metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s
     - Fetch metadata account info. If missing => metadata immutability = Unknown with subtitle “Metadata account not found”.
     - If found and you can decode updateAuthority: if updateAuthority is null/zero/none => Success else Warning “Metadata can be updated”.
     - If decoding is too heavy, keep it as Unknown with subtitle “Metaplex check not implemented yet” BUT still show row.
E) Token-2022 extension checks:
- For now, do not fully parse extensions unless you already have utilities.
- If program is Token-2022:
  - If you can detect TransferFeeConfig extension via existing code/util, mark Warning “Transfer fee extension present”.
  - Otherwise mark Unknown “Detailed extension parsing not implemented”.
- If program is SPL:
  - Set “Extension checks” row to not shown OR show Success “Not applicable”.

F) UI:
- Build a new card style similar to existing statsCard (rounded, padding).
- Each check row:
  - Left: icon (✅ / ⚠️ / ? as text) + title and subtitle
  - Right: status pill:
    - success: green “Success”
    - warning: orange “Warning”
    - unknown: gray “Unknown”
  - For token program row, show badge “SPL” or “Token-2022” on right instead of status pill, but still treat status as success if detected.
- Add “Rescan” button (Pressable) on header right; when scanning show ActivityIndicator small.

G) Human readable unknown:
- Replace raw “Unknown” with a subtitle:
  - “Unknown = not verified yet” or “Unknown = metadata not found” etc.
- Never show dev-y raw errors to user. Log errors to console only.

H) Add helper for time label:
function formatScanAge(scannedAtMs:number): string { return "just now" / "5m ago" / "2h ago" }

I) Keep everything inside AssetDetailScreen.tsx for now (since file is monolithic). Do not create new files unless absolutely necessary.

Acceptance tests:
1) Open any asset > About tab: Contract Security section appears and scans once; shows “Scanned by Cordon • just now”.
2) Tap Rescan: spinner shows; results update and scannedAt refreshes.
3) SPL token with no authorities shows Success for Mintable and Freezable.
4) Token-2022 token shows Token-2022 badge and Extension checks row as Unknown (unless you can detect TransferFeeConfig).
5) No crashes if RPC fails; show Unknown statuses gracefully.

Now implement this end-to-end and ensure it compiles.
