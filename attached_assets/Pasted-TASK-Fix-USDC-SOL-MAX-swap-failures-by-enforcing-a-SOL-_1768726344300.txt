TASK: Fix USDC→SOL “MAX” swap failures by enforcing a SOL fee buffer requirement (even when input token is not SOL), and clarify fee types.

CONTEXT:
- USDC→SOL swaps need SOL for network fee, priority fee, and often WSOL temp account rent (~0.002 SOL).
- Current UI only shows “Spendable” buffer when the input token is SOL, but USDC input still requires SOL in wallet.
- When user taps MAX on USDC, swaps can fail with Jupiter custom error 0x1788 because there isn’t enough SOL to fund the route’s required accounts/fees.
- Also, app currently charges a fixed SOL “success fee” after swap (“Charging success fee…”). That is separate from the 0.5% Jupiter platform fee.

GOALS:
1) Add a preflight “Required SOL for fees” calculation for ALL swaps (not only when input is SOL).
2) If user SOL balance < required SOL, disable Swap button + show a clear inline warning:
   “Need at least X SOL for network/priority/rent. Your SOL: Y. Add SOL to proceed.”
3) When user taps MAX on a non-SOL input (e.g., USDC), allow MAX as usual BUT still block swap if SOL balance is insufficient.
4) Improve error mapping: if swap fails with Jupiter custom error 0x1788, show user-friendly message:
   “Swap needs SOL for fees/rent (WSOL). Add ~0.002–0.01 SOL and try again.”
   (Do NOT claim “insufficient SOL” unless we detect SOL shortfall; but for 0x1788 in SOL-output routes, suggest SOL buffer.)
5) Do NOT change swap execution logic beyond adding the preflight and better error UI. Avoid touching working flows.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
A) In the swap UI (client), locate the swap screen component (e.g., client/screens/Swap or similar).
   - Add function estimateRequiredSolBuffer({speedMode, outputMint, routeSource}):
     * baseTxFeeLamports: 5000 (0.000005 SOL) as rough network fee estimate
     * priorityFeeLamports: map from speed mode (standard/fast/turbo) to your existing values (0.0008/0.002/0.005 SOL) if those are “priority fee” settings; convert to lamports.
     * wsolRentLamports: add 0.0021 SOL (2_100_000 lamports) ONLY when outputMint is SOL (So111... or native SOL route) because Jupiter often wraps/unwraps via WSOL.
     * successFeeLamports: if your app charges a post-swap fixed SOL success fee, include your MAX possible (e.g., 0.0006 SOL) plus an extra tx fee (0.000005 SOL) for the fee-transfer tx.
     Return totalRequiredLamports.

   - Compute:
     requiredSol = estimateRequiredSolBuffer(...)
     userSol = walletSolBalanceLamports
     solShortfall = max(0, requiredSol - userSol)

   - UI:
     * Under the Swap button (or near “Speed Mode”), show:
       “Required SOL buffer: ~X SOL” (small muted)
     * If solShortfall > 0:
       show a highlighted warning banner and disable Swap button.

B) MAX behavior:
   - Keep MAX for USDC as full token balance.
   - But if solShortfall > 0 after MAX, keep Swap disabled and show the warning.

C) Error handling:
   - In the swap submit try/catch, if error contains:
     - "custom program error: 0x1788" OR InstructionError Custom 6024
     then show modal/toast:
     “Swap failed because the route needs SOL for fees/rent (WSOL). Add more SOL (suggest ~0.002–0.01 SOL) and try again.”
   - Keep existing error handling for other cases.

D) Fee clarity (text only):
   - In the UI where “Charging success fee…” appears, add small info tooltip or label:
     “This is Cordon’s success fee (fixed SOL). Jupiter 0.5% platform fee is currently disabled.”
     (Do NOT add heavy UI; a subtle caption is enough.)

FILES TO TOUCH (search & edit):
- Swap screen component (where MAX button + Swap button lives)
- Any constants/util for speed mode fees
- Swap submit error handler (where you show “Swap Failed” modal)
Do NOT modify server Jupiter fee derivation logic in this task.

DELIVERABLE:
- After changes, USDC→SOL MAX should no longer “mysteriously fail”; it should clearly block with a SOL buffer warning if SOL is insufficient.
- 1 USDC and MAX should behave consistently: if user has enough SOL buffer, both work; if not, both are blocked with the same message.
