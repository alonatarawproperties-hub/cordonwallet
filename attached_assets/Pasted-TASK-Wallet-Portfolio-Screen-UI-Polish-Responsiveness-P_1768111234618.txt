TASK: Wallet/Portfolio Screen UI Polish + Responsiveness + Pull-to-Refresh

Goal:
Polish the current wallet/portfolio screen UI (balance card + Send/Receive/Swap + assets list + bottom nav) to feel more premium, fix spacing/proportions, and CONFIRM the build is fully responsive across screen sizes. Also add proper pull-to-refresh with a spinner and clean loading states.

1) Responsiveness & Layout Audit (MUST TEST)
- Test on:
  • iPhone SE (small)
  • iPhone 13/14 (normal)
  • iPhone Pro Max (large)
  • Android small + large (Pixel/Samsung)
  • Landscape orientation on both iOS/Android
- Confirm: no overflow, clipping, squashed text, stretched cards, or misaligned icons.
- Ensure safe areas are handled (iOS notch + home indicator) especially bottom nav.
- Provide BEFORE/AFTER screenshots for each device size (or emulator equivalents).

2) Action Buttons (Send / Receive / Swap) Proportions + UX
- Keep all three buttons equal width and visually balanced.
- Adjust proportions so buttons don’t feel too tall/heavy vs the card (reduce vertical padding slightly).
- Maintain minimum tap target:
  • iOS: 44pt
  • Android: 48dp
  (You can keep invisible padding even if visuals are smaller.)
- Add interaction states:
  • Pressed: scale ~0.98 + subtle highlight
  • Disabled (if applicable): lower opacity
- Ensure labels never wrap awkwardly or clip on small screens.

3) Wallet Header Row Spacing (Imported Wallet + addresses + copy icons + external link)
- Improve spacing and alignment so it doesn’t feel cramped.
- Fix baseline alignment of text + copy icons.
- On small screens:
  • Use stronger truncation OR stack addresses to 2 lines if needed.
  • Never push icons off-screen.

4) “Updated 0s ago” Hierarchy Fix
- Make it more subtle (smaller font + lower opacity).
- Move it to a less attention-grabbing position (e.g., aligned left under wallet name, or top-right inside the card), but keep it readable.

5) Assets List Density + Alignment
- Slightly reduce row/card height (less vertical padding) to fit more content cleanly.
- Make alignment consistent across all rows:
  • Token name + chain badge
  • Price + % change baseline
  • Amount + fiat value alignment
- Ensure chain badge (“Polygon/Solana/etc.”) sizing is consistent and doesn’t overpower the token symbol.
- Add clear row press feedback (subtle highlight) if rows are tappable.

6) Section Header (Assets + Approvals)
- Make “Approvals” feel like an intentional control:
  • Either style as a pill/chip/button OR convert to tabs (Assets | Approvals).
- Ensure it scales well on small screens (no overlap).

7) Loading States (Premium Feel)
- Initial load:
  • Prefer skeleton placeholders for balance card + asset rows (premium) OR a clean loader if skeleton is too much.
- Refresh:
  • Do NOT blank the UI; keep current data visible while refreshing.

8) Pull-to-Refresh (Portfolio Screen)
- Implement pull down to refresh on the main portfolio/assets list.
- Show a native-style spinner/loader while refresh is in progress.
- Requirements:
  • Trigger refresh only after a threshold pull distance.
  • Spinner stays visible while fetching.
  • Prevent double refresh (ignore gesture if already refreshing).
  • On success: stop spinner + update balances/prices/timestamps.
  • On error: stop spinner + show toast/snackbar “Refresh failed. Try again.”
  • Optional: light haptic feedback when refresh triggers (mobile).

9) Accessibility / Dynamic Font
- Test increased system font sizes (iOS accessibility / Android font scaling).
- Ensure no text clipping, overlap, or broken layout at larger fonts.

10) Deliverables
- Commit changes with clear comments.
- Provide:
  • Before/after screenshots for tested devices
  • Notes listing the responsive rules used (constraints/breakpoints/wrapping strategy)
  • Confirmation checklist that all items above were validated

Proceed to implement all improvements + tests. Avoid breaking existing navigation/logic. Focus on spacing, proportions, responsiveness, and clean UX states.
