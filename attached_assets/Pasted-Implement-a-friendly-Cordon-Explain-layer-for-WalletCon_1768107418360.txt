Implement a friendly “Cordon Explain” layer for WalletConnect Sign Message (Solana + EVM) WITHOUT modifying the signed payload.

Non-negotiable:
- The raw message bytes MUST remain unchanged. Signing must produce the exact signature the dApp expects.

UI/UX changes (Sign Message modal):
1) Header:
- Show dApp name + domain + Verified/Unverified badge (already implemented).
- Show chain badge (Solana/EVM).

2) Add a “Summary” card ABOVE the raw message:
- Title: “What you’re signing”
- Purpose: (auto-detect)
  a) If message looks like a challenge/nonce (long base58/base64, no spaces): “Login / Wallet verification”
  b) If contains SIWE keywords (domain, nonce, issuedAt): “Sign-in verification (SIWE)”
  c) Else: “Message signature request”
- Impact line (always show):
  “This does NOT move funds, and does NOT grant token approvals.”
- Risk badge:
  - Low for typical login challenge
  - Medium if message is unusual (very long + includes odd URLs or looks like encoded tx)
  - High if message contains suspicious phrases like “seed”, “private key”, “send funds”, “authorize spending”

3) Add an “Explain” button (Cordon Explain):
- When tapped, show 3 bullet explanation:
  - “Why this is requested” (best-effort based on detection)
  - “What it can/can’t do” (always include can’t move funds / can’t approve spending)
  - “Safety tip” (only sign if you trust {domain})
- Keep it short and friendly.

4) Raw message handling:
- Collapse raw message by default behind “View raw message”
- Provide Copy button for raw message

5) Red flag checks (warnings shown in summary if triggered):
- If domain is Unverified -> warning
- If message contains URL(s) with host not matching dApp domain -> warning
- If message contains any of these keywords (case-insensitive): seed, private key, recovery, wallet phrase, send funds, approve, transfer -> High risk warning

Implementation notes:
- Create a small pure function:
  analyzeSignMessage({message, dappDomain, chain}) => {
    purposeLabel,
    riskLevel,
    reason,
    warnings[],
    explainBullets[]
  }
- Use simple heuristics (no external AI calls required).
- Ensure “Sign” still signs the original raw message exactly.

Done when:
- The Sign Message modal is user-friendly by default
- Raw blob is hidden behind “View raw”
- The modal explains clearly that no funds move
- Signing output remains unchanged and dApp login still works
