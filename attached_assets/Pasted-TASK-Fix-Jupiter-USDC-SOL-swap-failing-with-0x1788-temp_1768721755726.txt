TASK: Fix Jupiter USDC→SOL swap failing with 0x1788 + temporarily disable platform-fee injection for SOL/WSOL output only, without breaking other swaps.

CONTEXT:
- Error: Jupiter Route fails with custom program error 0x1788 (InvalidAccountData).
- SOL is represented as WSOL mint on Jupiter: So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112.
- Common cause: our swap request (or client) is passing destinationTokenAccount / outputTokenAccount / or any token-account field when output is SOL, or we are pre-creating/forcing an ATA for WSOL incorrectly. For SOL output Jupiter must be allowed to wrap/unwrap via wrapAndUnwrapSol and manage temp WSOL accounts itself.
- We also want to temporarily disable platform-fee params ONLY when fee/output mint is SOL/WSOL (So111...), because fee-account derivation for WSOL can also break swaps.

DO THIS:

1) Search project for ANY Jupiter swap request builder (server + client) that sends fields like:
   - destinationTokenAccount
   - destinationTokenAccountAddress
   - outputTokenAccount
   - outputAccount
   - tokenAccount (anything that implies a token account for the output)
   - feeAccount / platformFeeBps / referralAccount
   This will likely be in:
   - server/swap/jupiter.ts
   - server/swap/index.ts or server/routes.ts
   - client/services/jupiter.ts (or similar)
   - any helper that constructs the body for POST /swap (lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap)

2) Implement a single helper on the server: normalizeJupiterSwapParams(quote, userPublicKey, maybeDestinationAccount)
   - Determine outputMint from the QUOTE response (not from UI).
   - Define:
     WSOL_MINT = "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
     isSolOutput = outputMint === WSOL_MINT
   - If isSolOutput === true:
       a) Ensure swap request includes: wrapAndUnwrapSol: true
       b) DO NOT include ANY destination/output token account field (remove it even if present)
       c) DO NOT attempt to create any ATA for WSOL on client or server for the destination
       d) Keep userPublicKey as normal.

   - If isSolOutput === false:
       a) OK to keep destination token account behavior as-is (if you already use it)
       b) Keep wrapAndUnwrapSol as currently used (usually false/undefined)

3) Platform fee temporary disable for SOL/WSOL output only:
   - In server/swap/jupiter.ts (or wherever platform fees are attached):
     If isSolOutput (or normalizedFeeMint === WSOL_MINT), force:
       - platformFeeBps = undefined
       - feeAccount = undefined
       - referralAccount = undefined
     Do NOT change behavior for other mints.

   - IMPORTANT: also ensure we are not accidentally passing disablePlatformFee flags that Jupiter ignores; the safest is simply: do not send platform fee fields at all for SOL/WSOL outputs.

4) Client-side safety (critical):
   - Ensure the client is NOT directly calling Jupiter swap endpoint with its own params bypassing server.
   - All swaps must go through our server endpoint so the SOL-output cleanup happens.
   - If the client is building/adding destination token account for SOL output, remove that logic:
     - If selected output is SOL (or outputMint WSOL), do not compute/create an ATA for output.

5) Add diagnostics (keep them but don’t spam):
   - Right before sending swap request to Jupiter, log:
     [JUP_SWAP_DEBUG] {
       outputMint,
       isSolOutput,
       hasDestinationTokenAccountField: boolean,
       wrapAndUnwrapSol,
       hasPlatformFeeFields: boolean
     }
   - Ensure for USDC→SOL:
       isSolOutput=true
       hasDestinationTokenAccountField=false
       wrapAndUnwrapSol=true
       hasPlatformFeeFields=false

6) Test plan (must run):
   - USDC → SOL swap: should no longer throw 0x1788.
   - SOL → USDC swap: must still work.
   - USDC → any SPL token swap: must still work.
   - SOL/WSOL output swaps should not include platform fee fields.
   - Non-SOL outputs keep existing fee behavior untouched.

DELIVERABLE:
- Commit the minimal code changes.
- Report exactly which files were changed and show the relevant diff snippets for:
  - SOL-output swap request cleanup
  - SOL/WSOL platform fee disable
  - Client bypass removal (if found)
