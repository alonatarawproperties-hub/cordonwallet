TASK: Fix ONLY the “+ Add Wallet” button behavior inside:
client/components/WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx

CURRENT ISSUE:
In the “Select Wallet” bottom sheet, tapping “+ Add Wallet” goes straight to Create Wallet. This is confusing because users also expect Import Wallet, but it’s hidden elsewhere (Manage screen).

GOAL:
When the user taps “+ Add Wallet” in WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx, show a choice:
1) Create New Wallet
2) Import Wallet
3) Cancel

Then route accordingly:
- Create -> navigate to the existing Create Wallet screen
- Import -> navigate to the existing Import Wallet screen

STRICT RULES:
- Only modify client/components/WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx.
- Do NOT touch wallet logic, storage, PIN flow, keychain, security, or any other screens.
- Do NOT change “Manage” button behavior.
- Keep existing navigation routes. DO NOT invent new routes. Find the existing ones used elsewhere in the app.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1) Open client/components/WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx and locate the “+ Add Wallet” button onPress handler.
2) Replace direct navigation with openAddWalletMenu().

3) Implement openAddWalletMenu():
   - iOS: use ActionSheetIOS.showActionSheetWithOptions
     options: ["Create New Wallet", "Import Wallet", "Cancel"]
     cancelButtonIndex: 2

   - Android (and fallback): implement a small local Modal inside this same file:
     - visible boolean state (e.g., addWalletMenuVisible)
     - a centered card or bottom sheet style with:
       - "Create New Wallet" button
       - "Import Wallet" button
       - "Cancel" button
     No extra libraries. Keep styling simple and consistent with current dark theme.

4) IMPORTANT: Close the WalletSwitcherSheet first before navigating (to avoid overlay stacking).
   - If WalletSwitcherSheet already has a close/dismiss function, call it before navigation.
   - If it uses a ref (e.g., bottomSheetRef.current?.close()), call it.
   - Then navigate with a short microtask delay:
     setTimeout(() => navigate(...), 0);

5) Routing:
   - Find the existing route names by searching in the repo for navigation to Create Wallet and Import Wallet.
     Examples: search for "CreateWallet", "ImportWallet", "create wallet", "import wallet".
   - Use the exact route names already used in the project.
   - Do NOT create new screens/routes.

6) After change:
   - Tapping “+ Add Wallet” always shows the menu (Create / Import / Cancel).
   - Selecting Create navigates exactly like before (just via the menu).
   - Selecting Import navigates to the existing Import Wallet screen.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
After you implement, reply with:
- the exact route names you used for Create and Import
- confirmation that only WalletSwitcherSheet.tsx was modified
