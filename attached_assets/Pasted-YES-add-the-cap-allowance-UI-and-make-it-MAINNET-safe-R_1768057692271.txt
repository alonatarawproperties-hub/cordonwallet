YES — add the cap-allowance UI and make it MAINNET-safe.

Requirements (must):
1) When an approve() is blocked due to unlimited allowance:
   - Show a “Cap Allowance” action in the Firewall preview sheet.
   - This must work for BOTH:
     a) in-app approve flows
     b) WalletConnect eth_sendTransaction approve requests

2) Cap Allowance UX (minimal, pro):
   - Bottom sheet / modal titled: “Set Allowance Limit”
   - Show token symbol + spender name/address + network
   - Input: amount (decimal)
   - Quick presets:
     - 25% of balance
     - 50% of balance
     - 100% of balance
     - “Custom”
   - Show “Estimated max spend” explanation in plain English:
     “This spender can spend up to X TOKEN. You can revoke anytime.”

3) Safety rules (mainnet):
   - Default cap suggestion: MIN(userTokenBalance, last intended spend if available)
   - Hard guardrail: do NOT allow cap > token balance * 1.05 unless user explicitly confirms.
   - Always re-run policy after setting cap, then proceed to sign if allowed.

4) Technical implementation:
   - For EVM approve tx, replace MAX_UINT with capped amountRaw using parseUnits(amount, decimals).
   - Ensure decimals are correct (read decimals if not already known).
   - Rebuild tx data using encodeFunctionData(approve ABI).
   - Preserve the same spender and token contract.

5) WalletConnect:
   - If a WC tx is approve() unlimited and blocked:
     - show the same Cap Allowance UI
     - modify the tx data to capped approve
     - then sign+broadcast and return the hash to the dApp.
   - If user cancels, reject the WC request with a friendly message.

6) Logging:
   - Save the resulting approval record with the capped allowance (not unlimited).
   - Mark “isUnlimited=false”
   - Approval screen should show the capped amount.

7) QA checklist (must pass):
   - A) Unlimited approve is blocked
   - B) Cap Allowance replaces it and successfully sends approve tx on MAINNET
   - C) Approvals screen shows the new capped approval
   - D) Revoke still works (approve 0)
   - E) WalletConnect approve requests follow the same behavior

Please implement this now with clean UI and no placeholders.
