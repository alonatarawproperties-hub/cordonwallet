TASK: After creating or importing a wallet, automatically set that wallet as the ACTIVE wallet, refresh UI, and return to main view showing the new active wallet (not the previous one).

Scope rules:
- Do NOT refactor architecture.
- Make the smallest safe changes.
- Reuse existing wallet store/actions.
- Do NOT break current working flows.

Where to implement:
1) The screen that finishes wallet creation (Create Wallet flow).
2) The screen that finishes wallet import (Import Wallet flow).
3) The wallet state/store that tracks “active wallet”.

Expected behavior:
- When user completes Create Wallet successfully:
  - The created wallet is persisted
  - Active wallet is set to the new wallet ID
  - UI refresh triggers (balances reload)
  - User is returned to main wallet/portfolio screen showing that new wallet name in header.

- When user completes Import Wallet successfully:
  - The imported wallet is persisted
  - Active wallet is set to the imported wallet ID
  - UI refresh triggers (balances reload)
  - User is returned to main wallet/portfolio screen showing that imported wallet.

Implementation details:
A) Find how wallets are stored and how active wallet is tracked.
   - Search for: activeWallet, selectedWallet, setActiveWallet, setSelectedWallet, walletId, currentWallet, WalletStore, useWalletStore, walletStore, walletSlice.
   - Identify:
     - Function that adds wallet: addWallet(...) or saveWallet(...)
     - Function that sets active wallet: setActiveWallet(walletId) or selectWallet(walletId)

B) In Create Wallet screen:
   - After wallet is created and stored, capture the new wallet’s id (or address).
   - Immediately call the store action to set active wallet:
       setActiveWallet(newWallet.id)
     (or whichever action exists)
   - Then trigger any existing refresh:
       refreshBalances()
     or invalidate queries, or emit existing event used on wallet switch.
   - Then navigate back to main view:
       navigation.navigate("MainTabs") or navigation.popToTop()
     Use the existing route used when closing create/import flows.
   - IMPORTANT: ensure the active wallet is set BEFORE navigation so the main screen renders new wallet.

C) In Import Wallet screen:
   - Same logic as Create:
     - After import success and wallet saved -> setActiveWallet(importedWallet.id)
     - trigger refresh
     - navigate back

D) Persistence:
   - If active wallet is persisted in AsyncStorage/SecureStore, ensure setActiveWallet writes to storage.
   - If not persisted currently, add persistence ONLY inside setActiveWallet action, not scattered in screens.

E) Safety checks:
   - If saveWallet returns walletId, use it.
   - If not, ensure addWallet returns the created/imported wallet object.
   - If wallet IDs are derived from address, compute consistently.

F) Testing:
   1) Create new wallet -> after finishing, header name shows new wallet and balances load.
   2) Import wallet -> after finishing, header name shows imported wallet and balances load.
   3) Switch wallets from WalletSwitcherSheet still works.
   4) Kill and reopen app -> active wallet remains the last created/imported wallet.

Deliverable:
- Provide the exact files changed and minimal code edits:
  - Create wallet screen: set active wallet on success
  - Import wallet screen: set active wallet on success
  - Wallet store: ensure setActiveWallet persists + triggers refresh signal (if needed)
- Do not change UI components except what’s needed for correct activation.
