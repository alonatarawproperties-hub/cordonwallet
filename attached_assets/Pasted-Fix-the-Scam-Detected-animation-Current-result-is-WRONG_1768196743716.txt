Fix the “Scam Detected” animation. Current result is WRONG: it looks like a reddish tint at the top/back and gets visually cut. I want a premium iOS/Siri-like aura overlay that sits IN FRONT of the UI and wraps the whole screen edges.

Tech: Expo + React Native.
Allowed: expo-blur, expo-linear-gradient, react-native-reanimated.
Do NOT: apply background tint inside Send screen container, do NOT use borders/glows attached to screen wrapper that can clip.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must match):
1) When scam/high-risk is detected, show a FULLSCREEN overlay on top of the Send screen UI (logo, inputs, buttons remain visible underneath).
2) The aura appears around ALL EDGES (top/bottom/left/right) like a “warning field”, not just top.
3) Overlay must NOT be cut by rounded containers or safe area; it must cover the whole device area.
4) It must feel like iOS/Siri glow: blurred, moving, premium — not a hard border.
5) Overlay is ABOVE everything: zIndex 9999 + elevation 9999. Use pointerEvents="none" (so user can still interact) unless we decide to block for High Risk later.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (do exactly):
A) Create component: src/security/SecurityAuraOverlay.tsx
- Props: visible:boolean, level:"low"|"medium"|"high", intensity?:number
- Render with <View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject} pointerEvents="none" />
- Inside it:
  1) A subtle BlurView layer (expo-blur) to give premium feel:
     - <BlurView intensity={12..20} tint="dark" style={absoluteFill} />
     - keep opacity low so it doesn’t wash out UI
  2) Edge gradients (expo-linear-gradient) so aura wraps edges:
     - Top gradient: height ~140, colors: [riskColor with 0.45 alpha -> transparent]
     - Bottom gradient: same, reversed
     - Left gradient: width ~80
     - Right gradient: width ~80
     These must be positioned absolute and cover all edges.
  3) Animated “Siri blobs” (3-4 circles):
     - Use Reanimated shared values to slowly move blobs around (translateX/translateY) + pulse scale/opacity
     - Each blob is a <Animated.View> with big size (260-420), borderRadius: 999
     - backgroundColor = riskColor with low alpha (0.18..0.30)
     - Put BlurView over them OR set them behind edge gradients but still inside overlay
     - The blobs must drift slowly (8–14 seconds loops), not jittery.

B) Mount overlay at ROOT so it can’t clip
- In App.tsx (or your root layout), render <SecurityAuraOverlay .../> ABOVE NavigationContainer or inside a root overlay host:
  <SecurityOverlayProvider>
    <AppNavigator />
    <SecurityAuraOverlay visible={...} level={...} />
  </SecurityOverlayProvider>

C) Trigger from Send screen logic
- On scam detected: set risk level to "high" and set overlay visible true
- On leaving Send screen OR clearing recipient address: hide overlay

D) Colors (monochrome-ish + premium):
- Low:  #2E90FF (alpha)
- Medium: #FFB020 (alpha)
- High: #FF3B30 (alpha) with slight orange (#FF6A3D) secondary blobs
Keep it consistent with our dark theme.

E) Must fix “cut” issue
- Ensure overlay is NOT inside any rounded card/container.
- absoluteFill at root + zIndex/elevation.
- No SafeAreaView clipping. Use full-screen.

Deliver: implement overlay + show it on scam/high risk. It should look like a front aura field, not a background tint.
