IMPLEMENT CORDON SUCCESS FEE (0.50%) ON SOLANA SWAPS — OUTPUT TOKEN FEE, HIDDEN IN UI, WAIVE IF TREASURY ATA MISSING

SCOPE / RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- DO NOT refactor or change any working swap execution flow besides adding fee parameters.
- DO NOT add any new UI elements to show the fee. Fee must be hidden in the Swap UI for now.
- DO NOT add extra signing prompts. Swap must remain 1 transaction / 1 user signature.
- DO NOT create ATAs on-chain in beta. If treasury ATA is missing, WAIVE the fee for that swap.
- If fee logic errors for any reason, fallback to feeBps=0 and continue swap (never block swaps).

CONFIG
- Solana Treasury Wallet (Cordon Treasury):
  6pcN26cpKbWmGyRn8DgRjqRzpBW2CFp8PK5wZ9gTArpE
- Success fee percent (fixed for now): 0.50%
- Convert percent -> feeBps internally:
  feeBps = Math.round(0.50 * 100) = 50

WHERE TO CHANGE (LIKELY FILES)
- server/swap/jupiterClient.ts (quote + swap requests)
- server/swap/index.ts (API handlers)
- server/swap/config.ts or server/swap/types.ts (add fields/types if needed)
- DO NOT change client/screens/SwapScreen.tsx except if absolutely necessary for API compatibility. Do NOT show fee in UI.

SERVER IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

A) QUOTE: Jupiter GET /v6/quote
1) When building the quote URL, ALWAYS request feeBps=50 for Solana swaps:
   - Add feeBps=50 to query params (or via existing query builder).
2) Return quotes normally; no UI changes needed.
3) (Optional but useful) Include in server response metadata (NOT shown in UI):
   - successFeePercent: 0.5
   - feeBpsRequested: 50

B) SWAP: Jupiter POST /v6/swap
Goal: Apply platform fee via Jupiter feeAccount (treasury ATA for the OUTPUT mint), but WAIVE if missing.

1) Determine outputMint for the chosen quote/route (outputMint from quote).
2) Compute treasury ATA for outputMint:
   - Use @solana/spl-token getAssociatedTokenAddress
   - owner = SOLANA_TREASURY_WALLET
   - mint = outputMint
3) Check if treasury ATA exists:
   - await connection.getAccountInfo(treasuryAta)
4) If ATA EXISTS:
   - Call Jupiter /v6/swap with:
     - feeBps: 50
     - feeAccount: treasuryAta (string)
   - Everything else stays exactly as currently working.
5) If ATA MISSING:
   - WAIVE fee safely:
     - Call Jupiter /v6/swap with feeBps: 0
     - Omit feeAccount entirely
   - Log server warning:
     "[SwapFee] Treasury ATA missing for mint <mint>. Fee waived."

6) If any error occurs during ATA compute/check:
   - Fallback to feeBps: 0 (omit feeAccount) and proceed.

C) DO NOT BREAK EXISTING TYPES / CLIENT
- Keep existing API shapes stable.
- If you add metadata fields, make them optional and do not require the client to render them.
- Do not introduce new required fields that would break the current Swap UI.

VALIDATION / ACCEPTANCE TESTS
1) Swap SOL -> USDC:
   - If treasury USDC ATA exists, fee should apply (treasury receives some USDC).
   - If treasury USDC ATA missing, swap still succeeds and fee is waived.
2) Swap SOL -> random token:
   - Swap succeeds regardless.
   - Fee applies only if treasury ATA exists; otherwise waived.
3) No new fee text appears anywhere in Swap UI.
4) No additional signature prompts.
5) No changes to priority fee / turbo mode / slippage logic.

DELIVERABLE
- Minimal diffs only.
- Add clear inline comments near fee logic.
- Keep swap working exactly as before.
