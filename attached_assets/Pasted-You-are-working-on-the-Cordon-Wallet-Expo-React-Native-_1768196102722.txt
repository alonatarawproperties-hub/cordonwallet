You are working on the Cordon Wallet (Expo + React Native). We have a “Scam Detected” / risk warning feature, but the animation is awful and our new overlay attempt crashes with:

“Maximum update depth exceeded … SecurityOverlayContext.tsx (37:13) setState …”

Goal:
1) FIX the infinite render loop in SecurityOverlayContext by refactoring state updates so they never run on every render.
2) Replace the current red border animation with a PREMIUM “Siri-like” security aura overlay:
   - Full-screen overlay above content (not cut off), subtle blur + animated gradient glow around edges
   - Works on iOS, looks premium, monochrome blue/white normally; turns red/orange for High Risk
   - Overlay should animate IN and OUT smoothly, and not block interactions unless in “High Risk” mode
   - Must not introduce any render loops or heavy CPU usage.

Constraints:
- Expo managed workflow.
- Prefer react-native-reanimated for animations.
- If needed, use expo-blur for blur.
- Avoid libraries that require native rebuild unless already installed.
- Keep UI consistent with existing dark theme.

Implementation Details:

A) Fix SecurityOverlayContext
- Replace any useEffect that calls setState without stable deps.
- Expose stable API:
   - showRiskOverlay(payload)
   - hideRiskOverlay()
- showRiskOverlay must only update if payload actually changed (compare previous to next).
- Use useReducer OR useRef-based “last payload” guard to prevent repeated updates.
- Ensure the context value is memoized (useMemo) and functions useCallback.

Create / update these files:
1) src/security/SecurityOverlayContext.tsx
2) src/security/useSecurityOverlay.ts
3) src/security/SecurityAuraOverlay.tsx

B) Siri-like Security Aura Overlay
- SecurityAuraOverlay renders at the ROOT of app (above NavigationContainer) using a portal-like approach:
   - Absolute fill view, pointerEvents="none" for low/medium risk, pointerEvents="auto" for high risk (to force user to acknowledge)
- Visual:
   - Dark blur glass layer (very subtle)
   - Animated “aura” on edges: use a couple of large radial-ish gradients / blobs that slowly move (left↔right, up↔down) with opacity pulsing
   - Colors by risk:
       Low: #2E90FF / #66C7FF
       Medium: #FFB020 / #FFD38A
       High: #FF4D4D / #FF7A59
   - Add a soft vignette on edges so it looks like iOS/Siri glow.
- Add a small “Risk Card” at bottom that slides up when visible:
   - Title: “Security Warning”
   - Risk badge: Low / Medium / High
   - Reason text from payload
   - Buttons:
       - For Low/Medium: “Continue” and “Cancel”
       - For High: “Cancel (Recommended)” and “I Understand, Continue”
   - Only for High risk, require explicit “I Understand, Continue”.
- The overlay should be triggered when we detect scam address on Send screen:
   - When user taps “Review Warning”, call showRiskOverlay({ level, reason, chain, action, details })
   - When user cancels or continues, call hideRiskOverlay()

C) Integration
- In App root (e.g., App.tsx or RootStackNavigator.tsx), wrap app with <SecurityOverlayProvider>.
- Render <SecurityAuraOverlay /> once near root so it can appear above all screens.
- Ensure no circular renders. Keep overlay state isolated.

D) Bug Proofing
- Add console.warn guard if showRiskOverlay is called repeatedly with identical payload.
- Add unit-ish sanity: log once per visibility change (optional).
- Make sure overlay animations do not depend on rapidly changing props that trigger re-renders.

Deliverables:
- Working build with no “Maximum update depth exceeded” crash.
- The new premium Siri-like aura overlay appears smoothly and is not cut off.
- High Risk requires explicit confirmation.
- Low/Medium does not block interaction (visual only unless user opens details).
- Code is clean, typed (TS), and commented minimally.

Now implement.
