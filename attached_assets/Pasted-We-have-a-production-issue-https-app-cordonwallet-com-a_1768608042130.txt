We have a production issue: https://app.cordonwallet.com/api/swap/health returns 404.
This is NOT a Jupiter issue; it means the route is not deployed/mounted/forwarded.
Fix this end-to-end in ONE pass, no questions, production-ready.

GOAL:
1) Add /api/swap/health endpoint in the swap router.
2) Ensure swap router is mounted under /api/swap in server/index.ts (or equivalent entry).
3) Ensure the deployment/proxy forwards /api/swap/* to the Node server (same as /api/health).
4) Improve server health endpoint to check BOTH Jupiter + RPC with timeouts and clear JSON.
5) Update client error message to distinguish 404 vs real network vs 5xx.

TASKS:

A) SERVER ROUTING (must fix 404)
1. Locate server entry (likely server/index.ts). Confirm Express app mounts:
   - app.use("/api", apiRouter) or similar
   - swap router must be mounted EXACTLY at "/api/swap"
2. If swap router is currently mounted at a different path, change to:
   app.use("/api/swap", swapRouter)
3. Add an integration test-style log on boot:
   - Print all registered routes (only in dev) OR log "Swap router mounted at /api/swap".

B) ADD HEALTH ENDPOINT (server/swap/index.ts)
1. Implement GET "/health" in swap router (so full path is /api/swap/health).
2. Response JSON:
   {
     ok: true,
     ts: Date.now(),
     services: {
       jupiter: { ok: boolean, status?: number, latencyMs?: number, error?: string },
       rpc: { ok: boolean, latencyMs?: number, url: string, error?: string }
     }
   }
3. Jupiter check:
   - Fetch https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote with a minimal SOL->USDC query.
   - Use AbortController timeout 5000ms.
   - Capture HTTP status, latency, and short error.
4. RPC check:
   - Use Connection(process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL) with timeout 5000ms (race).
   - Call getLatestBlockhash or getHealth.
   - Return url + latency + error if any.

C) PROXY / DEPLOY FORWARDING (fix production 404)
1. Find where /api/health is defined and confirm it's under the same server process.
2. Identify any reverse proxy / static host config in server/templates or deployment scripts.
3. Ensure the rule forwards "/api/*" INCLUDING "/api/swap/*".
   - If a config exists (nginx, cloudflare worker, vercel.json, etc), update it so /api/swap routes hit the backend.
4. Add a note in README or server/deploy docs: "Verify /api/swap/health after deploy".

D) CLIENT ERROR MAPPING (stop showing generic “network issue” on 404)
1. Wherever swap quote/token requests are made, if response.status === 404:
   Show: "Swap API not deployed (404). Check backend routing for /api/swap/*"
2. If 429: show "Rate limited — retrying"
3. If >=500: show "Backend error (status)"
4. If fetch throws: show "Cannot reach backend"

E) VERIFICATION (must be included)
1. Add a simple curl commands section in replit.md (or server README):
   - curl https://app.cordonwallet.com/api/health
   - curl https://app.cordonwallet.com/api/swap/health
2. Locally: add npm script "server:health" that hits localhost /api/swap/health.

DELIVERABLE:
- Commit changes.
- After deploy, /api/swap/health MUST return 200 in production (not 404).
- Client must clearly show 404 vs real network errors.
