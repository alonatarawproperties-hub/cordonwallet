GOAL: Phase I = Solana only. Hide/disable all EVM flows. Show “Coming soon” where relevant.
RULES:
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT remove WalletConnect entirely; keep it for Solana dApps.
- Keep app stable: no dead buttons leading to blank pages.
- Any EVM entry point must be gated with a single reusable “ComingSoon” UI.

1) Add a global feature flag:
Create: client/config/features.ts
export const FEATURES = {
  EVM_ENABLED: false,
  SOLANA_ENABLED: true,
} as const;

2) Create a reusable Coming Soon modal/screen:
Create: client/components/ComingSoonSheet.tsx
- Props: title, description, onPrimary, onClose
- UI: clean bottom sheet or modal matching existing style.

3) Onboarding gating:
Find onboarding create/import account flows.
- Any option that creates/imports EVM wallets (Ethereum/Polygon/BNB/Arbitrum or “EVM”) must be hidden OR replaced with a card/button that opens ComingSoonSheet.
- Solana create/import remains unchanged.

4) Main UI hiding:
In wallet/asset management screens:
- Filter out any chains that are not Solana when FEATURES.EVM_ENABLED is false.
- Hide chain tabs/icons for ETH/BNB/POL/ARB.
- Hide token list rows whose chain is EVM.
Do not delete data models; just filter at render time.

5) WalletConnect (Solana-only):
In client/lib/walletconnect/client.ts and context usage:
- When receiving a session proposal:
  - If proposal requiredNamespaces include eip155 OR any EVM chain ids, then:
    - Reject session with a clear reason: “EVM chains coming soon”
    - Trigger UI: ComingSoonSheet with “EVM Chains Coming Soon”
  - If proposal is solana namespace only:
    - Continue existing flow.

6) Browser dApps discovery:
In Browser screen/discovery list:
- Hide EVM-specific featured dApps if any.
- Keep Solana ones.

7) QA checklist:
- User can onboard and use Solana wallets normally.
- No EVM chain icons appear anywhere.
- If user lands on an EVM dApp and taps connect, they get Coming Soon immediately (no QR waiting).
- Solana dApps (ex: jup.ag) still connect.
