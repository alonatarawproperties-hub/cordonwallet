Implement “Cordon Success Fee” for Solana swaps with transparent UI + Free vs Pro schedule. Success fee must be charged ONLY after swap confirms, as a separate SOL transfer transaction. Do NOT change existing swap execution logic (Jupiter swap tx). Do NOT refactor unrelated code.

TARGET
- Traders + gamers
- Monetize per confirmed swap (success fee)
- Pro users pay 0 success fee (toggle, can be mock for now)

FEE SCHEDULE (hardcode constants for now)
- Free plan:
  - Standard: 0.00020 SOL
  - Fast:     0.00035 SOL
  - Turbo:    0.00060 SOL
- Pro plan:
  - All modes: 0 SOL
- Fee wallet address (fee collector):
  - Add env/config constant: CORDON_FEE_WALLET_SOLANA (string)
  - If missing, default to a placeholder but DO NOT crash; just skip charging and warn in logs.

REQUIREMENTS
A) UI (SwapScreen)
1) In client/screens/SwapScreen.tsx:
   - In Advanced Settings OR under amount field, add a new section:
     - Title: “Cordon Success Fee”
     - Text: “{fee} SOL — charged only if swap confirms.”
     - Subtext: “This does not affect slippage or your swap price.”
   - Add a toggle:
     - “Enable success fee” (default ON)
     - If user is Pro, allow toggling OFF (fee becomes 0).
     - If user is not Pro, toggle ON is forced (or OFF disabled with “Pro required” label).
2) Display the computed fee based on:
   - selected speed mode (Standard/Fast/Turbo)
   - pro status
   - enable toggle

B) Swap execution behavior
1) Swap flow stays exactly the same up to confirmation.
2) After the swap tx is confirmed SUCCESSFULLY, attempt to charge success fee:
   - Create a new SOL transfer tx from user -> fee wallet for feeLamports
   - Sign with the user’s key (same wallet signing path you already use for SOL transfers)
   - Submit and confirm it.
3) If success fee tx fails:
   - Do NOT revert or mark swap as failed.
   - Show a non-blocking warning banner/toast:
     “Swap confirmed. Success fee pending.”
   - Persist a “pending fee charge” item so we can retry later.

C) Storage / retry
1) Create a lightweight local queue using AsyncStorage:
   - key: "cordon_pending_success_fees"
   - array of objects:
     { id, createdAt, userPubkey, feeLamports, swapSignature, status, attempts }
2) When a fee tx fails, store an item with status "pending".
3) On app startup OR on opening SwapScreen, attempt to retry pending fee charges:
   - Only retry if userPubkey matches current wallet
   - Backoff: only retry if last attempt > 30 minutes ago OR attempts < 3
   - If success, mark status "paid" and optionally remove after 24h
4) Keep it simple; no server needed.

D) Safety / UX rules
1) Do not charge if:
   - computed feeLamports == 0
   - fee wallet missing or invalid
   - user has insufficient SOL for the fee transfer (then mark pending)
2) Prevent user confusion:
   - In the swap success UI, show:
     - “Swap confirmed ✅”
     - “Success fee charged ✅” OR “Success fee pending ⏳”
3) Ensure this does NOT interfere with “Spendable SOL” logic:
   - When input is SOL, include the success fee in the reserved fees calculation ONLY IF the success fee toggle is enabled and fee > 0.
   - That means: reserveLamports += successFeeLamports (so user doesn’t spend all SOL and then fee can’t be collected).
   - BUT if you already reserve priority cap, keep that as well.

E) Code locations / new files
1) Add: client/constants/successFee.ts
   - export fee schedule constants
   - export function getSuccessFeeLamports(speedMode, isPro, enabled)
2) Add: client/services/successFeeService.ts
   - enqueuePendingFee()
   - tryChargeSuccessFeeNow()
   - retryPendingFeesForCurrentWallet()
3) Minimal edits:
   - client/screens/SwapScreen.tsx (UI + hook call after swap confirm)
   - client/store/swapStore.ts or wherever swap confirmation is handled (call service after success)
   - client/lib/solana/feeReserve.ts (add optional successFeeLamports into reserve calc)

F) Testing checklist (must verify)
1) Free user, Turbo selected:
   - UI shows 0.00060 SOL
   - Do swap, swap confirms
   - fee tx is sent and confirmed
   - history shows fee transfer
2) Free user, spends near max SOL:
   - “Spendable SOL” decreases by success fee amount
3) If user has 0 SOL left post-swap:
   - swap confirms
   - fee charge fails
   - pending item saved
   - banner shows “fee pending”
4) Pro user:
   - fee displays 0
   - no fee tx created

DELIVERABLE OUTPUT
- Implement all changes above.
- Keep diffs minimal and do not break swap.
- After implementation, add a short dev note in replit.md explaining how success fee works and where to change fee wallet address.
